This section includes also includes questions about requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a name='TemplateandScope'></a></p>\n<p><strong>1. Question:</strong> What is the difference between a template and a scope?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A template is a framework, or collection, of requirements that relate to one another. A scope is a set of requirements that relate to one another and describe the boundaries of a project or audit framework. We recommend that you create a scope by converting a template to a scope.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about templates and scopes, see the articles listed below:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115016129608.html' target='_self' rel='noopener'>Glossary of Compliance Terms</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360046400313.html' target='_self'>Compliance Management Module Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360045245034.html' target='_self'>How to Create Custom Templates for Scopes</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360046703714.html' target='_self'>How to Convert a Template to a Scope</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a name='TemplateTypes'></a></p>\n<p><strong>2. Question: </strong>What types of templates can I use in my KCM GRC platform?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> KCM GRC has four types of templates that you can use in your platform. To learn how to use each template, see the list below:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Custom Templates</strong>: You can use custom templates in the Compliance Management module to select requirements that you will work toward under a scope. Custom templates are most useful if your organization has unique compliance objectives that our managed templates do not cover. For information about creating custom templates, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360045245034.html' target='_self'>How to Create Custom Templates for Scopes</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Managed Templates</strong>: You can use a managed template in the Compliance Management module to convert the template into a scope. Managed templates already include requirements, so they are a simple alternative to creating a custom template. After you convert a managed template to. a scope, you can create or map additional requirements, or you can unmap requirements that do not apply to your organization. For information about the managed templates that we offer, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360022753993.html' target='_self'>Managed Templates</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Policy Templates</strong>: You can use policy templates in the Policy Management module to document your organization's policies. Your KCM GRC account offers ten policy templates that you can download and customize for your organization. For information about customizing policy templates and the policy templates that we offer, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/1500006135402.html' target='_self'>Policy Templates</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Risk Templates</strong>: You can use risk templates to add risks from our master risk repository to your <strong>Risk Register</strong>. Risk templates have pre-populated names and descriptions, and you can customize details such as the risk status, likelihood, and impact. Risks that you import to or create from your <strong>Risk Register</strong> also appear in the <strong>Risk Templates\u00a0</strong>area of your platform. For more information about risk templates, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360010296394.html' target='_self'>Risk Templates</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Questionnaire Templates</strong>: You can use questionnaire templates in the Vendor Risk Management module to create questionnaires that you will send to your vendors. KCM GRC offers questionnaire templates for the Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) questionnaire and the Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ). For more information about questionnaire templates, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360021582594.html' target='_self'>Creating and Configuring Questionnaires</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a name='ConvertScopes'></a></p>\n<p><strong>3. Question: </strong>I\u2019ve converted my template to a scope. What should I do next?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>Now that you have converted your template to a scope, the next step is to complete a scope self-assessment for the scoped requirements. The scope self-assessment can help you see how much progress your organization has made in meeting the requirements for the scope. This information can help you determine which requirements you can quickly create controls for in your platform and which requirements your organization will need to work on. \u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360036241614.html' target='_self'>How to Complete a Scope Self-Assessment</a> article.</p>\n<p><a name='AddReqstoScope'></a></p>\n<p><strong>4.

Question: </strong>When uploading or creating a new requirement, what is the default ID Separator?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>When you add new requirements to your platform, you can set the type of character to use between the numbers or letters that make up your <strong>Requirement ID</strong><em>. </em>This character is known as the<strong> ID Separator</strong>. The <strong>Requirement ID</strong> is a combination of the requirement's\u00a0<strong>Primary ID</strong> and <strong>Sub ID</strong>. The <strong>ID Separator</strong> will display between the <strong>Primary ID</strong> and <strong>Sub ID</strong>.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> The <strong>Requirement ID</strong> determines the order that your requirements will display in templates and scopes. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360045245034.html' target='_self'>How to Create Custom Templates for Scopes</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<p>To set the ID separator character, you will select one of the following options from the <strong>ID Separator</strong> drop-down menu:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><strong>Space Separated ( )</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Comma Separated (,)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dash Separated (-)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dot Separated (.)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do not select a seperator from this drop-down menu, the default separator will be used. If your <strong>Primary ID</strong>\u00a0and <strong>Sub IDs</strong> only contain numbers, the default separator will be a period. If your <strong>Primary ID</strong> and <strong>Sub IDs</strong> contain numbers and letters, the default separator will be a space.</p>\n<p><a name='ExportScope'></a></p>\n<p><strong>6.

Question:</strong> What is the difference between a control and a task?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>A control is an action or procedure that you are taking to ensure that you are meeting the associated requirement or requirements.You assign a task schedule to a control. The task schedule determines how often your organization must provide evidence to prove that you're meeting the control. By meeting a control, you are proving that your organization is either partially or fully satisfying the requirement or requirements that are mapped to the control.To learn more, see our definitions of <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115016129608.html' target='_self'>Controls</a> and <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115016129608.html' target='_self'>Tasks</a> in our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115016129608.html' target='_self'>Glossary of Compliance Terms</a>.

Question: </strong>What is the KCM GRC task reminder email schedule?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>When you've assigned a user to a task, the console will automatically send reminder notifications to the <strong>User Assigned</strong> before the task evidence is due. To learn more about the task reminder emails, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360052578153.html' target='_self'>Control Task Notifications</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360052578153.html' target='_self'>Email Notifications and the Email Digest</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> If a user is set to receive multiple notifications in one day, these notifications are combined into one email digest with the subject line: \"KCM GRC Email Digest\". For example, if a user is assigned to multiple tasks that are due on the same day, they will receive one email which will include reminders for each of the tasks that are due that day.</div>\n</div>\n<p><a name='TaskPastDueFail'></a></p>\n<p><strong>5. Question:</strong> When is a control task considered <strong>Past Due</strong> or <strong>Failed</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can create and assign various <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360050048234.html' target='_self'>types of tasks</a> to ensure that you are maintaining your organization's compliance controls. For both one-time tasks and task schedules, if the assigned user does not mark a task as complete before the task's due date, the following will occur:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>One day past the due date, the task's status will change to <strong>Past Due</strong>.</li>\n<li>Seven days past the due date, the task's status will change to <strong>Failed</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> By default, tasks will remain in the <strong>Past Due</strong> status for seven days. If you would like to change the length of time that tasks are <strong>Past Due</strong> before they change to <strong>Failed</strong>, you can modify the <strong>Task Fail Interval</strong> setting under your <strong>Account Settings</strong> area.

Question: </strong>How can I see a list of which tasks are not 100% compliant?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Tasks that are not compliant are tasks that are not in the <strong>Satisfied </strong>status. To view a list of tasks that are not in this status, see the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>Tasks</strong> page by selecting <strong>Tasks</strong> from the navigation panel.</li>\n<li>From the <strong>Status</strong> column, click the drop-down menu and select the following statuses:\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><strong>Active</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Failed</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Past Due</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The page will show all incomplete tasks that are either coming due or have passed their due date.\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> If you would also like to view a list of the tasks that are complete but are still waiting for approval from a manager,\u00a0click the drop-down menu from the <strong>Approval Stage</strong> column and select <strong>Awaiting Approval</strong>.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a name='Archive_Delete'></a></p>\n<p><strong>7. Question:</strong> What is the difference between archiving and deleting a control?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If you would like to keep a record of the control evidence or if you believe it could be used again with a different requirement, you should archive the control instead of deleting the control. If you archive the control, the control task schedules will be deleted from the <strong>Task Schedules</strong> tab. However, if you unarchive the control, the control tasks, evidence, control documents, requirement mappings, risk mappings, and the control's health score will still be associated with the control.

In this article, you will learn about the benefits of the PAB and our recommendations for how to implement the PAB in your organization. To see which version of the PAB is best for your organization, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/1500011951662.html' target='_self'>PAB Compatibility Matrix</a>.

If your organization\u2019s mail environment supports the PAB, your users can use this tool to protect your organization from cyberattacks. The PAB can benefit your organization in the following ways:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Your users can use the PAB to report simulated phishing tests or potential phishing emails. The PAB provides an easy option for your users to report suspicious emails without sending the emails directly to your IT team, help desks, or managers.</li>\n<li>When your users click the PAB to report an email, they will receive an instant message thanking them for keeping your organization secure. You have the ability to customize this message, if you\u2019d like. For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Enable and Configure PAB</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Phish Alert Button (PAB) Product Manual</a>.</li>\n<li>When your users report a non-simulated phishing email, we can forward this email to an email address of your choice. We recommend that you set up a separate email address for this purpose, such as phishalert@example.com. For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Enable and Configure PAB</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Phish Alert Button (PAB) Product Manual</a>.</li>\n<li>You can send copies of reported phishing emails to KnowBe4 for analysis. We analyze these emails to learn about new phishing attacks and to create new phishing email templates, such as our Reported Phishes of the Week templates.

The tool then analyzes the passwords against ten potential password vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Your results will display which user accounts failed the test and why. This information can empower you to increase your organization's password complexity requirements, train your users about safe password practices, or take other actions to help your organization's security.</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/wpt/EN/WeakPasswordTest.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/wpt/EN/WeakPasswordTest.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8ESADZXCP0Z324X9C3RE8VM'>System Requirements and Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>To run WPT, your system must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Windows 10 or later (32 or 64-bit), Windows Server 2016 or later</li>\n<li>Active Directory (AD), running on Windows Server 2008 R2 or later</li>\n<li>Ability to access the domain controller (DC)</li>\n<li>Internet access</li>\n<li>.NET Framework 4.7.2, will be installed if needed</li>\n<li>At least two processors</li>\n<li>At least 2GB of RAM</li>\n<li>At least 1GB of hard disk drive (HDD) space available on your system drive</li>\n<li>User Account Control (UAC) enabled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend running this test on a system other than your DC, as the scanning process can temporarily generate significant network traffic and central processing unit (CPU) usage.</p>\n<p>For installation, you will need the following information:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>The license key that you received via email upon signing up for the test.</li>\n<li>The domain name of your AD.

These passwords are either very common, easy to guess, or have been made available to attackers because of past data breaches.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Shared Password: </strong>This failure indicates that the affected account shares a password with at least one other account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Empty Password: </strong>This failure includes accounts that do not have a set password.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Clear Text Password: </strong>This failure includes passwords that are stored in clear text in an Active Directory (AD). This means the users' AD passwords are stored using reversible encryption.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password Not Required: </strong>This failure includes accounts that have the capability of not having a password.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password Never Expires: </strong>This failure indicates that the account has its password timeout set to zero. Because of this setting, even if the <strong>Password never expires</strong> check box in the user\u2019s properties is unchecked, their password will never expire. WPT will check password expiration settings in your organization\u2019s domain policies, fine-grained password policies, and user properties.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>LM Hash Password: </strong>This failure indicates that the affected account uses a Local Area Network (LAN) manager hash, which is an antiquated method. These passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks and can be quickly cracked.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>AES Encryption Not Set: </strong>This failure indicates that the account doesn\u2019t use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt the user\u2019s password. AES encrypts passwords with a 128-bit or 256-bit key. Passwords that use AES encryption are less vulnerable to attacks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>DES-Only Encryption: </strong>This failure indicates that affected accounts were set up using the retired Data Encryption Standard (DES) mechanism. This could be a result of old software that doesn\u2019t know how to react to AES.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Missing Pre-Authentication: </strong>This failure indicates that affected accounts have pre-authentication, a security mechanism, turned off. When enabled, pre-authentication creates an encrypted authentication request so that attempts to authenticate to the account are logged.</p>\n<p>This account may be at risk of a brute force attack. Brute force attacks can occur offline and are difficult to detect.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='iv_h_01HKQ5T0VDDCK34EF99K01ZABJ'>Settings</h2>\n<p>There are different settings you can choose from to allow you to customize your WPT.

After you configure ADI, users and groups will be automatically added, changed, and archived in your KSAT console based on information sent from your AD. It's important to note that this is a one-way process of synchronization, and no information will be sent back to your AD from your KSAT console.</p>\n<p>To learn about the benefits of configuring ADI for your organization, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/6162437423635.html'>Benefits of Setting Up Active Directory Integration (ADI)</a> article.

For more information, see the list below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you've configured ADI, the data that is synced from your AD is considered authoritative. The following actions will occur during syncs between your KSAT console and your AD:\n<ul>\n<li>Users who are not found in your AD will be archived in your KSAT console.</li>\n<li>If you've made changes to a user's information in your KSAT console, these changes will be overwritten by the data that is contained in your AD.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prior to ADI, user accounts in the KSAT console are considered console-managed. When users are console-managed, you can edit user information by <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204873347.html'>uploading a CSV file</a> to your console or by editing <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360009588974.html'>user profiles</a> directly in your console.\n<ul>\n<li>Once you configure ADI and the first AD sync occurs, users are considered AD-managed. When users are AD-managed, you will need to edit user information in your AD and these changes are then pushed to the KSAT console during the next sync.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>During the first AD sync, the KSAT console will automatically match console-managed user accounts with accounts in your AD. This process will convert your users from being console-managed to AD-managed. We've outlined how this process works below:\n<ol>\n<li>You will install and configure the ADI sync tool in your environment. For details, see the <a href='#h_01HAA5E9HG0WQCJ9T6RK3SZT0Z'>Installation and Configuration</a> section of this article.</li>\n<li>You will configure what information you want to sync from your AD.\u00a0For details, see the <a href='#h_01HAA5E9HGZ9KWSGRKAHBN5AMC'>Defining Which OUs, Groups, and Users to Sync</a> section of this article.</li>\n<li>Then, the ADI sync service queries your AD or directories for user and group information and sends the results to KnowBe4's servers.</li>\n<li>KnowBe4's servers review the information sent from your AD and the servers automatically update the users and groups in your KSAT console according to the following logic:\n<ol>\n<li>If an AD user has an email address that matches an existing KSAT console account, then that KSAT console user account becomes AD-managed.</li>\n<li>If an AD user is not found in the KSAT console, then an AD-managed user account is created.</li>\n<li>After all AD users have been processed, any console accounts that have not become AD-managed will be archived.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01JXJDP507BE6NRM3028J5SHVN'>Protections that Secure ADI Auto-updates</h3>\n<p>There are a few protections that make sure ADI auto-updates are secure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The metadata about the installer file is downloaded using the HTTPS protocol.</li>\n<li>The installer file is downloaded using the HTTPS protocol.</li>\n<li>After downloading the installer file and before executing it, KnowBe4 ADI Sync checks the file's checksum and ensures that it has a valid digital signature from KnowBe4.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you configure ADI, user information will stay up-to-date with the information in your organization's AD.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HAA5E9HGTWKPG9786HW8YN0V'>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before you configure ADI, make sure that your environment meets our basic requirements listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your organization must have <strong>Microsoft Active Directory</strong> or <strong>Microsoft Entra ID</strong>. See the list below for more information:\n<ol>\n<li>If your organization has <strong>Microsoft Active Directory</strong>, your domain functional level must be Windows Server 2016 or later.</li>\n<li>If your organization has<strong> Microsoft Entra ID</strong>, you can sync Microsoft Entra ID Domain Services with your KSAT console.

Groups can be used to target certain departments or create spear-phishing attempts on key staff members. You can even target multiple groups in a single phishing campaign. By using groups, you can conduct phishing campaigns for specific regions or locations if you are interested in obtaining specific metrics from these campaigns.</p>\n<p>We recommend that you create groups for different locations, repeat clickers, management, and other sets of high-risk users. Our Smart Groups feature helps with the creation of these types of groups. You can learn more about Smart Groups (Platinum or Diamond only) in our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8354913796115.html'>Smart Groups Overview</a> article.</p>\n<p>To see how Groups are doing in terms of their Phish-prone Percentage and number of phishing failures, such as clicks, go to <strong>Phishing</strong> &gt; <strong>Reports</strong> to use our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360007952894.html'>Reporting</a> feature.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HC01D0M8W7JZYKRTRNMBMEBW'>Groups and Training Campaigns</h2>\n<p>When you set up a training campaign, you can choose to enroll all users or only enroll specific groups of users.</p>\n<p>You can also set up an automated remedial training for a Clickers group to provide additional training to users who frequently fail tests from phishing campaigns. Then, you can remove those users from the Clickers group upon completion of the remedial training. You can also re-enroll the users in the future if they fail another phishing test. For more information about remedial training, read our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/206280728.html'>Using Groups for Remedial Training</a> article.</p>\n<p>You can use groups to track training progress and run reports on different groups of users. For example, you could find out how many members of the Clickers group have started but not completed a specific course. Any training-related report can also be filtered by group. Group reports can be found on the <strong>Reports</strong> tab as well as under the main Reports tab, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360007952894.html'>Reporting</a> article for more information.</p>\n<p>You can also use groups to track the training progress of users on a staggered or ordered basis. For example, you could set up four campaigns, one for each quarter of the year. Each campaign can start at the beginning of each quarter, with the Q1 campaign targeting All Users. The subsequent three campaigns can target a Q2 group, Q3 group, and Q4 group. Your Q1 campaign could add completed users to the Q2 group, your Q2 campaign could add completed users to the Q3 group, and so on. This way, users will only be enrolled in the additional courses if they have completed the previous campaign's courses, such as a prerequisite.</p>",

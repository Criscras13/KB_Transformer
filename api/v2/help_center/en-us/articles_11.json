In our initial, free PST, this email includes text to trick users into clicking an embedded link. We offer several different types of PSTs based on your organization's needs. To see what PSTs will look like in your users' inboxes, you can preview PSTs in your KnowBe4 account, such as the PST preview below. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Phishing/PSTarticle_examplephishingtest.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Phishing/PSTarticle_examplephishingtest.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>If the user clicks the link in the PST, they will be directed to a <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204240768.html'>landing page</a>. Our basic landing pages tell the user they failed a simulated phishing test and give them some tips for inspecting emails in their inbox. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Phishing/landingpageexample.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Phishing/landingpageexample.png' alt=' ' width='612' height='383'></a></p>\n<p>After you send a PST to your users, you will be able to view their PST results. The results will include the number of users who failed the test divided by the number of users who received the test. This number is the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010178267.html' target='_self'>Phish-prone Percentage</a>, or the percentage of your users who failed the PST.</p>\n<p>The PST can provide your users with real-world practice for recognizing and responding to social engineering attacks. You can also use the PST to supplement and reinforce any training that your users take.</p>\n<p>If you're a current KnowBe4 customer, you probably already have access to this tool. To learn more about our PSTs and best practices for using PSTs, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204843728.html'>Phishing Security Test (PST)</a> product manual.

      "body": "<p>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a standard for logging users into applications based on their session in another context. SAML enables single sign-on (SSO), which allows users to log in to multiple applications using one set of credentials.</p>\n<p>This method has significant advantages over logging in using a username and password. With this method, users don't need to type in credentials, don't need to remember and renew passwords, and won't have to worry about weak passwords. Most organizations already know the identity of users because they are logged into their Active Directory domain or intranet. It is natural to use this information to log users into other applications as well such as web-based applications, and one of the more elegant ways of doing this is by using SAML.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about SAML, read the below sections.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01GTFHJME5YRTHG2JNHVPNNDH0'>How SAML/SSO Works</h2>\n<p>SAML single sign-on (SSO) works by transferring the user's identity from the identity provider to the service provider. This process is done through an exchange of digitally signed XML documents. Consider the following scenario: A user is logged into a system, which acts as an identity provider. The user would like to log into a remote application such as their KnowBe4 Learner Experience or another service provider.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, the following steps occur:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>The user clicks on the link to the application by using their corporate intranet, a bookmark, or a similar option. Then, the application loads.</li>\n<li>The application identifies the user's origin and redirects the user back to the identity provider by asking for authentication. To identify the user's origin, the application uses the application subdomain, the user's IP address, or similar information. This is the authentication request.</li>\n<li>The user either has a session with the identity provider already, or the user establishes one by logging into the identity provider.</li>\n<li>The identity provider builds the authentication response in the form of an XML document containing the user's username or email address. Then, the identity provider signs the document using an X.509 certificate and posts this information to the service provider.</li>\n<li>The service provider retrieves the authentication response and validates it using the certificate fingerprint. The service provider already knows the identity provider and has a certificate fingerprint. The identity of the user is established.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a visual aid for this workflow, see the screenshot below:<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FAQ/SAML01.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FAQ/SAML01.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>For more information about the basics of how SAML and SSO works, see auth0's <a href='https://auth0.com/blog/how-saml-authentication-works/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>What is SAML and how does SAML Authentication Work</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01GTFHJY9A71VR9ZPXV75ZWVSD'>How SAML for the Learner Experience (LX) Works</h2>\n<p>KnowBe4 supports SAML 2.0. SAML functions for KnowBe4's Learner Experience (LX) the way SAML does with all other service providers. Typically, an organization's user authentication is managed by its chosen authentication system, such as Active Directory (AD) or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). These authentication systems are referred to as identity providers.</p>\n<p>The service provider, in this case, the LX, allows the identity provider to authenticate users and then log them into their LX. In other words, users can log in at work and have automatic access to their organization's applications such as their email or their customer relationship management (CRM) system without having to log in separately to those services.

Expand the below sections to learn more.</p>\n<ul class='js-toggles'>\n<li title='Recipient Analysis'>\n<p>Prevent analyzes the recipients you add to an email draft to ensure there are no issues with the recipients you are emailing.</p>\n<p>When a risk is found, the following workflow is typically seen:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Microsoft Outlook, write your email and add recipients as normal.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open the Prevent task pane.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Add-In/Open+task+pane.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Add-In/Open+task+pane.png' alt='An image of the KnowBe4 icon in the Microsoft Outlook ribbon'> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>If Prevent detects potential risks regarding the email recipients, the red or amber sections on the task pane will automatically expand to display further information.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review your recipients and adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005CRZT.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005CRZT.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Send your email as normal.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01JQA0Z65Q6DC4BA7Q3PZ45SNW'>Triggers</h3>\n<p>As you add recipients to your email, Prevent will be working in the background to detect anything unusual. If you have the Prevent task pane open, you will see the <strong>Email Advice</strong> section update dynamically as you change your recipient list. The advice displayed to you will be color-coded in relation to the severity of the risk detected. The task pane will give you further information about what has been detected and may offer you suggested actions.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005D77F.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005D77F.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li title='Nudges'>\n<p>By analyzing the subject line, message body, and attachments, Prevent can help you ensure that incorrect or sensitive data is not sent to the wrong recipients. This reduces the risk of critical data breaches occurring and their subsequent consequences.</p>\n<p>When a risk is found, the typical workflow is followed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Microsoft Outlook, compose your email as normal.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Send</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Prevent detects a risk, you will receive a nudge.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Nudges/Misdirected.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Nudges/Misdirected.png' alt='An image of an example nudge you may recieve from Prevent'> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>You can select either <strong>Send anyway</strong> or <strong>Don't Send</strong>, at which point you can edit the content of the email and resend it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01JQA0Z65QGX1D8CY4CCJ77PNE'>Triggers</h3>\n<p>See the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/39515676762515.html'>Prevent - Nudges</a> article to learn more about the triggers that can cause Prevent to nudge you when you send an email.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

      "body": "<p>Incoming emails from outside your organization will have colored banners inserted using Defend. These banners inform you of how the email has been classified after Defend analyzes the content and detects potential threats. The color of the banner corresponds to the associated level of threat.</p>\n<p>The banners are interactive tools designed to enhance your security awareness in real time. Each banner interaction serves as a mini-training session, providing specific information about why an email might pose a threat and helping you understand potential risks over time. An email can receive multiple banners simultaneously, either from the same category or different categories, depending on the threats detected.</p>\n<p>There are four banner categories displayed below:</p>\n<ul class='js-toggles'>\n<li title='Productivity Banners'>Productivity banners are gray and are applied to emails that Defend classifies as graymail or spam. These emails are usually non-malicious bulk emails such as newsletters, announcements, or advertisements. The purpose of these banners is to act as a visual cue for easy categorization and improved productivity.\n<p><br>An example of a productivity banner is displayed in the screenshot below: <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Gray+banner.png' width='256' height='61'></p>\n</li>\n<li title='Benign Banners'>Benign banners are blue and are informative alerts that are not associated with detected threats. These banners are designed to provide additional context about an email and typically do not require any specific action. Benign banners may notify you about various email characteristics, including:\n<ul>\n<li>New sender: The email is from someone who has never emailed you before.</li>\n<li>Financial content: The email contains financial information or references.</li>\n<li>External source: The email originates from outside your organization.</li>\n<li>Sensitive information: The email includes content that may be considered sensitive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>These banners increase awareness and help you make informed decisions about handling an email. While no immediate action is usually necessary, the information provided can be valuable for assessing the email's relevance and importance.</p>\nAn example of a benign banner is displayed in the screenshot below:<img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/External+Sender.png' width='346' height='61'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Blue+banner.png' width='390' height='61'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Sensitive+Information.png' width='630' height='61'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Financial+Banner.png' width='695' height='61'>\n</li>\n<li title='Suspicious Banners'>Suspicious banners are amber and are applied to emails that contain suspicious elements, potentially indicating phishing or impersonation attempts. These banners serve as a cautionary alert, prompting you to exercise increased vigilance. When you encounter an amber banner, follow the tips below:\n<ol>\n<li>Exercise caution before taking any action on the email.</li>\n<li>Carefully inspect the sender's email address to verify its authenticity.</li>\n<li>Be wary of clicking on any links within the email.</li>\n<li>Avoid downloading or opening attachments unless you are certain of their safety.</li>\n<li>If you need to reply, double-check that you're sending to the legitimate sender, not a similar-looking fraudulent address.</li>\n<li>When in doubt, verify the email's legitimacy through an alternative communication channel, such as a phone call or in-person confirmation.</li>\n<li>Report suspicious emails to your IT or security team for further investigation.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>An example of a suspicious banner is displayed in the screenshot below:<img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Amber+banner.png' width='672' height='61'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Impersonation+Banner.png' width='775' height='61'>\n</li>\n<li title='Dangerous Banners'>\n<p>Dangerous banners are red and are applied to emails exhibiting strong indicators of phishing or other malicious intent. These banners represent the highest level of threat warning. When you encounter a dangerous banner, follow the tips below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not click on any links or download any attachments within the email.</li>\n<li>Refrain from replying to the email or engaging with the sender.</li>\n<li>Do not forward the email to others, as this may spread the potential threat.</li>\n<li>Report the email immediately to your IT security team.</li>\n<li>Delete the email from your inbox after reporting it unless instructed otherwise by your IT team.</li>\n</ol>\nRemember, dangerous banners indicate a severe risk, and it is important to treat these emails as genuine threats. Your organization's security protocols should always be followed when dealing with dangerous-bannered emails.<br>\n<p><br>An example of a dangerous banner is displayed in the screenshot below:<img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Red+banner.png' width='791' height='61'></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01K4PVE1QM6T8JP04F75X5Z2WF'>Email Summary Page</h2>\n<p>All banners applied by Defend can be clicked on. This feature allows you to learn more about what was detected in the email. If you think an email has been categorized incorrectly, you can report it by selecting a reporting button at the bottom of the email summary page.

In this example, Defend identifies strong signs of phishing and recommends following your organization's policy for reporting phishing emails.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Primary Reason</strong>: This area describes the primary reason the email raised concerns and triggered the banners.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Threat dial</strong>: The colored threat dial displays the risk rating that Defend has assigned to this email. In this example, Defend has assigned the highest risk classification.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Email information</strong>: This section displays advanced email information, including details such as the sender address, sender location, email security protocols, and your previous interaction history with the sender.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Report this email</strong>: The reporting section allows you to report the email if you believe it has been classified incorrectly by Defend.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01K4PVV15VFNMMBT230QZMB1NM'>Link Protection</h2>\n<p>Defend includes link protection that helps safeguard you from malicious links in emails, even when they appear legitimate. This protection works by checking links in your emails in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When the email arrives</li>\n<li>When you click on links</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This dual approach helps protect you against links that may seem safe at first but later direct you to harmful websites. Attackers sometimes change where a link goes after an email is delivered, and Defend helps catch this trick by verifying links in real-time when you click them.</p>\n<p>When Defend detects a potentially harmful link that you've clicked, you'll see a warning screen instead of being taken directly to the website. This protective screen shows you the actual destination web address, indicates the specific signs of phishing that were detected, and highlights when the sender is being impersonated. This information helps you make an informed decision about whether it's safe to proceed to the website, protecting you from phishing attempts and other malicious sites that could compromise your security.</p>\n<p><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Admin+Console/Defend+Link+Scanning.png'></p>",

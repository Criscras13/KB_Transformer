You can use Lucene to run queries in your PhishER Inbox or on the <strong>PhishRIP Queries</strong> page.</p>\n<p>This article is an overview of Lucene query syntax to help you get started with running custom queries in your PhishER platform. For more information, see Apache\u2019s <a href='https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Lucene - Query Parser Syntax</a> documentation.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HAQFSWC76THZYCXNQPXC69CJ'>Writing a Query</h2>\n<p>Lucene query syntax can be broken down into three parts: fields, terms, and operators or modifiers. You can use these strings to run queries, which allow you to search for messages from your PhishER Inbox and on the <strong>PhishRIP Queries</strong> page. You can use a combination of a field, term, and an operator or modifier to form a query string. Below is an example of a Lucene query string:</p>\n<p><code>field_name: \"This is the phrase I want to search for!\" AND \"This\"</code></p>\n<p>See the sections below to learn more about writing a query string using fields, terms, and operators or modifiers.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HAQFSWC72Z0HR0V7NG5K9QPZ'>Fields</h2>\n<p>A field is the ID or name used to find specific information from a message.

Points are based on the percentage of simulated phishing emails you report and how quickly you report them.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important: </strong>If a campaign is deleted, the points you earned from it will be deducted from your total points on the leaderboard.

The bonus starts at 8,640 points, which equals two points for every minute of the earning period. From the time you receive a test email to the time you report it, the bonus decreases by two points every minute.For example, if you report a test email as soon as you receive it, you earn 8,640 bonus points. If you report a test email exactly one hour after receiving it, you earn 8,520 bonus points.</p>\n<p>Using the examples above in our formula, your total points would be 9,270.</p>\n<pre>(1000 x 75%) + 8520 = 9270</pre>\n<h2 id='h_01HKAWY3XKM0QE1ZK5QBV4RYCQ'>Group Leaderboard</h2>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/learner_experience/leaderboard.png'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/learner_experience/leaderboard.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>On the group leaderboard, you\u2019ll work in groups to complete all of your assigned training on time. The more training your group members have completed, the higher your group is on the leaderboard. Your organization sets up who is in each group and what the timeframe is for the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>Groups are ranked according to the percentage of training completed. This percentage is calculated by dividing the number of training assignments for each group member by the number of assignments they have completed.</p>",

Steps one and two are required, and steps three to five are optional but recommended.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2HNY6DFA2XFDHRM23KP0CK'>Step One: Whitelist Our Mail Servers</h2>\n<p>Before you start phishing and training your users, you\u2019ll need to whitelist our mail servers. Whitelisting will ensure our Phishing Security Tests (PSTs) and training notifications reach your users\u2019 inboxes. To learn more about whitelisting KnowBe4, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645138' target='_self'>Whitelisting Guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, contact <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/requests/new' target='_self'>our support team</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2HNY6DXT6DMEQCJMQ4YTK3'>Step Two: Add Your Users</h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to add your users' email addresses to your KSAT console to set up phishing and training campaigns. There are a few different options for importing your users' information into your console. You can use one of these three available methods to make user management an easy and automated process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Active Directory Integration (ADI): If you\u2019re using Active Directory, we recommend setting up ADI to maintain your user list automatically. Once ADI is set up, your KSAT console will automatically update user and group information based on data received from your Active Directory (AD). To learn more about setting up ADI, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/228373888'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide.</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM): KnowBe4's SCIM integration enables seamless user management in your KSAT console by using data from your SCIM identity provider (IdP). To learn more about configuring SCIM for your KnowBe4 console, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052380374-SCIM-Configuration-Guide#PROVIDERS'>SCIM Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Google User Provisioning (GUP): This integration enables automatic synchronization of user data between Google Workspace and your KnowBe4 console. If you\u2019d like to import users directly from your Google account into your KnowBe4 console, we recommend looking at our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/29586165576339-Google-User-Provisioning-GUP-Guide'>Google User Provisioning (GUP) Guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alternatively, you can add users manually or import them with a CSV file. For further information, see our<a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204873347-Import-Users-with-a-CSV-File'> Import Users with a CSV File</a>\u00a0article.</p>\n<p>You can choose how to group your users, such as grouping them by department or location. You can also target groups with phishing and training campaigns and allow groups to compete against each other on leaderboards.</p>\n<p>To learn more about adding your users, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204936887#ADDINGUSERS' target='_self'>Adding Users</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204936887' target='_self'>Users and Groups</a> guide.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2HNY6D78T4XNEWYRV5XF1X'>Step Three: Customize Your Account</h2>\n<p>You can customize your account and LX from your Account Settings.

For high risk users, we recommend bi-weekly testing. Regular phishing tests will allow your users to practice the skills they\u2019ve learned in their security awareness training.</p>\n<p>To set up an ongoing phishing campaign, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your KnowBe4 account and navigate to the <strong>Phishing</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>+ Create Phishing Campaign</strong> button.</li>\n<li>On the <strong>New Phishing Campaign</strong> page, create your campaign using the recommended settings listed below:\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/PSTs_NewConsoleSvelte.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/PSTs_NewConsoleSvelte.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Campaign Name:</strong> Enter a name for your phishing campaign here. This field is required.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Send to:</strong> Click <strong>All Users</strong> if you would like to test all users. Or, if you only want to test specific users, click <strong>Specific Groups</strong> and select the groups you would like to test.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Template Topics:</strong> From the first drop-down menu, select the template topics with which you would like to test your users. Use the <strong>Set Template Language</strong> check box to select the languages you want to use in this phishing campaign. If multiple languages are selected, users will receive templates in any of the selected languages. This setting will override <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060622513-Localization-Guide#default_language'>the account\u2019s default phishing language</a> and <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060622513-Localization-Guide#user_language'>the language set in the user\u2019s profile</a>. When this check box is selected, the <strong>Language Override</strong> drop-down menu will appear.

We recommend that you do not change this setting.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Landing Page:</strong> You can select a specific landing page that you would like to use for all the phishing tests in this campaign, or you can leave this setting set to <strong>Default Landing Pages</strong>.

Your default time zone is the one set in your Account Settings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sending Period:</strong> Select <strong>Send emails over\u2026</strong> and set a timeframe of at least three business days. Setting a time period of at least three business days will ensure that your users don\u2019t receive the tests all at once and can\u2019t warn other users about the test. Depending on the <strong>Frequency</strong> option you selected, we recommend sending emails over one week for bi-weekly campaigns and over three weeks for monthly campaigns.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Define Business Days and Hours:</strong> By default, your campaign will only send emails during the business hours set in your Account Settings. You can change the hours your emails are sent by entering a start and end time in this field. You can also choose what days you would like emails to be sent by selecting the date check boxes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Track Replies to Phishing Emails:</strong> You can select this check box if you would like to track your users' replies to phishing test emails. We recommend that you only select this check box for reply-to phishing campaigns. For more information about reply-to phishing, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/234956728-Reply-To-Phishing-Guide'>Reply-to Phishing Guide</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Track Activity:</strong> We recommend that you track activity for at least three days.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Add Clickers to:</strong> You have the option to add users who fail the phishing test to a selected group. You can then add this group of users to a remedial training campaign at a later date. For more information about remedial training, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/206280728-Create-a-Remedial-Training-Campaign'>Create a Remedial Training Campaign</a> article.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Send an email report to account admins after each phishing test:</strong> Select this check box if you would like account admins to receive an email when each phishing test is complete.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hide from Reports:</strong> Select this check box to hide the phishing campaign from user profiles and phishing reports. Hidden campaigns will not impact Risk Scores or Phish-prone Percentages. We recommend using this option when running a test campaign for whitelisting or other phishing functionality tests.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Send SecurityTips that reveal missed Social Engineering indicators for phishing failures:</strong> Customers with a SecurityCoach subscription can send SecurityTips to users that reveal missed Social Engineering Indicators (SEIs) for phishing failures. This feature lets users receive real-time coaching about the red flags they missed after a simulated phishing test failure.

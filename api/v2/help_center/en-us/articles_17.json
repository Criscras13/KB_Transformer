Then, PhishER assigns tags to emails that meet your rule criteria.</li>\n<li>Tags trigger PhishER to perform your specific actions. Based on your organization's customized rules and actions, PhishER will automatically disposition each email. Dispositioning helps you prioritize reported emails and respond quickly to real phishing attacks.</li>\n<li>If you have enabled the PhishER Blocklist, you can use information about malicious or spam emails to block similar emails from reaching your users' inboxes. If you have a PhishER Plus subscription and have enabled the Global Blocklist, you can use crowd-sourced information to block similar emails.</li>\n<li>If you have enabled PhishRIP, you can remove similar malicious or spam emails that have reached your users' inboxes already. If you have a PhishER Plus subscription and have enabled Global PhishRIP, you can use crowd-sourced information to remove similar emails.</li>\n<li>If you have enabled PhishFlip, you can reuse reported emails to create KSAT phishing templates and campaigns.

The description should include what the control is, how to review and assess the control, what type of <a href='#EVIDENCE'>evidence</a> is expected as a result of a review, and where that evidence should be placed. If you should need to change ownership of the control's tasks, providing these details will make it much easier for the new user (or <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360049480674.html' target='_self'>user group</a>) to understand what is expected.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The control description is used in\u00a0<a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360012357353.html' target='_self'>Detailed Compliance Reports</a>.\u00a0Additionally, when <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360050048234.html' target='_self'>creating task schedules for your controls</a>, by default, the control description will be used as the task description.

A control can have multiple schedules.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If tasks are needed outside of a recurring schedule, you can create tasks on an ad-hoc basis by creating a <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360050048234.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>one-time schedule</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When creating a task schedule for a control, you will assign a user to be responsible for completing the tasks under that schedule.

If you are currently using a centralized storage area on your internal network for maintaining audit evidence, you do not need to upload files to KCM GRC. By providing a URL to the evidence, you get the benefit of linking that information to a specific control (via a <a href='#TASKS'>task</a>) without storing files in multiple places.</p>\n<p>Additionally, any web-based file storage application can be used, whether it's internal to your network or external, such as Sharepoint, Dropbox, Google Drive, Jira, etc.</p>\n<p><a name='Requirements'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J2YBNW50SYCGPQVKW06NAPBT'>Requirements</h2>\n<p>A requirement is a concrete statement that describes a compliance objective, audit finding, best practice, or another obligation that the organization is striving to achieve or correct.</p>\n<p>Some examples of requirements are:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>PCI DSS 1.1.2 \u2013 Current Network Diagram \u2013 There must exist a current network diagram with all connections to cardholder data, including any wireless networks.</li>\n<li>HIPAA 164.308(a)(2)(ii) \u2013 Facility Security Plan \u2013 Implement policies and procedures to safeguard the facility and the equipment therein from unauthorized physical access, tampering, and theft.</li>\n<li>Internal IT Audit FY2015 \u2013 Finding #4 Missing Security Patches \u2013 The following servers did not have the most recent security patches applied: SERVER1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use requirements from the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360022753993.html' target='_self'>managed templates</a> that are offered by KCM GRC, or you can create custom requirements.

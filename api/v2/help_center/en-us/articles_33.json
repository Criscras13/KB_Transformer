It shows your users exactly what Social Engineering Indicators, or red flags, they overlooked when they clicked on a simulated phishing email.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> SEI is only available to Platinum and Diamond subscription levels.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1MPRK5KC04M4GV4VSA96GD'>Why Should I Use SEI?</h2>\n<p>SEI reinforces your cybersecurity awareness training efforts by answering the common question from users \"How do I know emails are phishing emails?\" The point-of-failure feedback they receive does not include vague, generalized tips. What they will see instead is the exact phishing test email they clicked on, pointing out the details that should have raised a red flag for them. This feature enhances and strengthens your security awareness training program.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1MPRK58V58NCDSX0GH1CP5'>How Does it Work?</h2>\n<p>Once you set up a phishing test with one of our built-in SEI landing pages, and your user fails a phishing test by clicking a link or opening an attachment, they will be taken to the landing page, which will display exactly what red flags should have caused them to be suspicious.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample of SEI Landing Page</strong></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/security_coach/SEI_LandingPageExample.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/security_coach/SEI_LandingPageExample.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p>Our phishing templates are pre-loaded with red flags to get you started on dynamically training your users through this method.</p>\n<p>To preview the red flags on our templates, click on <strong>Phishing &gt; Phishing Templates &gt; System Templates</strong>, then click any topic to see what templates are in that topic.

Alternatively, you can make your own SEI landing page. To learn how to create your own SEI landing page, see <a href='#SEIlandingpage'>How Do I Add the SEI Template Placeholder to Another Landing Page?</a></p>\n<p>Choose what topics you'd like to use in the campaign, as well as any other settings you prefer for your test. If you're selecting your own topics rather than our built-in templates, be sure that your templates contain red flags.</p>\n<p><strong>Selecting the SEI Landing Page</strong></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/security_coach/SEI_SelectingSEILandingPage.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/security_coach/SEI_SelectingSEILandingPage.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1MPRK58WZGA0RZKWFK3T2Y'>Can I Use SEI With Any Phishing Template or Landing Page?</h2>\n<p>Yes! Our phishing templates are pre-loaded with red flags to get you started quickly and easily. You can alter our existing red flags however you wish but keep in mind that after making changes to a System Template, the template will be saved as a new template under the <strong>My Templates</strong> area.</p>\n<p>You can choose an SEI landing page from within the template editor or when you set up the phishing campaign. Choosing the SEI landing page when you set up the phishing campaign is recommended.</p>\n<p>For landing pages, we've included SEI landing pages to get you started, but you can easily make your own or edit our other landing pages to include the SEI template placeholder. See: <a href='#SEIlandingpage'>How Do I Add the SEI Template Placeholder to Another Landing Page?</a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1MPRK5BKBGPP7NHXSTA807'>How Do I Add Red Flags to Templates?</h2>\n<p>You'll want to navigate to the template you'd like to edit under <strong>Phishing &gt; Phishing Templates &gt; System Templates</strong>. In any of the phishing emails in <strong>System Templates</strong>, you can clone a template to use in your phishing campaigns. When you clone a template, it will automatically be saved to the <strong>My Templates</strong> section of the <strong>Phishing Templates</strong> subtab. Then, simply click on the title of the template to open the template editor.</p>\n<p>You'll notice the option <strong>A</strong><strong>dd a Red Flag</strong> around the elements of the template. Simply click on <strong>A</strong><strong>dd a Red Flag</strong> to add or edit the red flag. For example, in the LinkedIn template below, an alternative red flag could say <strong>The sender email is coming from our domain, rather than LinkedIn</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can also add red flags to any text, links, or images in the body of the email. To do so, select the text, link, or image and then click the <strong>Red Flag</strong> button on the menu bar. Enter the text for the red flag as you wish, then click OK.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of a Red Flag on Sender Email and Text Within Email Body</strong></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SEI/BodyRedFlag.gif'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SEI/BodyRedFlag.gif' alt=' ' width='1017' height='608'></a></p>\n<p><strong>Example of a Red Flag on a Link and a Generic Red Flag</strong></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SEI/LinkandGenericRedFlag.gif'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SEI/LinkandGenericRedFlag.gif' alt=' ' width='977' height='584'></a></p>\n<p>If you'd like the red flag to be an overall red flag for the whole email template, click the <strong>Red Flag</strong> button and enter the red flag text, then click the Generic Flag checkbox on.</p>\n<p>An example generic red flag for the above template could be <strong>This LinkedIn email is vague. If you hover over the link, you will see it doesn't take you to the LinkedIn website. Think before you click! </strong></p>\n<p>Once you save your template, you can find it under the <strong>Phishing Templates &gt; My Templates</strong> area.

Find where you'd like to enter the red flag.</p>\n<p>If you want to mark a red flag on <strong>a particular line of text, image, or link</strong>, you'll want to contain the item to be flagged within the following code:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;x-sei title='Here is the text of the red flag.'&gt;Here is the text,\n    image or link you'd like to mark as a red flag.&lt;/x-sei&gt;</code></p>\n<p>If you would like to mark a <strong>Generic Flag</strong> on the template (an overall explanation of why the user should have been concerned about clicking the links in the email), you can do so with the following code:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;x-sei generic='true' title='Here is where you can place Generic Flag\n    text, to let the users know why they should have known the email was\n    potentially dangerous.'&gt;&lt;/x-sei&gt;</code></p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1MPRK5F9379CE25YE141R4'>How Do I Add the SEI Template Placeholder to Another Landing Page?</h2>\n<p>In your landing page editor, there is a drop-down called SEI Placeholders. Click this drop-down and add <strong>Red flag indicators</strong><span> to add the placeholder. Wherever you add the placeholder is where the SEI-flagged template will appear. You can also type the placeholder </span><strong>[[template_sei]]</strong><span> anywhere on the landing page if that is easier.</span></p>\n<div class='callout-warning'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong> To avoid display issues with SEI placeholders on your landing pages, we recommend using simple HTML code that does not include scripts. As a security measure, the What You See is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor does not allow you to save certain code or scripts.</div>\n</div>\n<p>You can edit one of our existing landing pages, or create your own from scratch.</p>\n<p><strong>Landing Page Editor</strong></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='http://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SEI/AddingSEIPlaceholderToLP.png'><img src='http://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SEI/AddingSEIPlaceholderToLP.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>Once the landing page is finalized, simply click Save.

If both SSO and password-less logins are enabled, users with access to KnowBe4 through SSO will log in through their SSO portal and authenticate with their identity provider. Users who don't have SSO accounts will have to wait for their password-less login notification to log in.</p>\n<p>As a final best practice after enabling password-less logins, you should be especially aware of what training notifications you're using. We offer built-in templates with the <strong>password-less</strong> tag containing the password-less login placeholder, which will automatically populate your training notification. Alternatively, you can create your own templates that include our password-less placeholders.

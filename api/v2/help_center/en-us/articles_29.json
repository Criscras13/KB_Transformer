The Tines platform allows you to connect to a REST API or web application and automate your workflows.</p>\n<p>With this integration, you can use webhooks to send information from your PhishER console to your Tines platform. For example, you can configure webhooks to notify your Tines platform when a user reports an email using the Phish Alert Button (PAB). You can also configure webhooks to send automatic notifications from a SOAR platform to a communication tool, such as Slack. By using this integration, you can simplify workflows and save time for your organization.

      "body": "<p>If you are running a phishing campaign and see results that are unusual, you may be experiencing false clicks. When reviewing campaign results, if you see a 100 percent click rate or IP addresses that don't belong to your organization, this can be an indication of false positives. Below are some of the common reasons for false positives as well as some tips for handling them.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HBVJBX3Q7EXS1SZ9EVKQ5ARM'>What Is Considered a Click?</h2>\n<p>Clicks are what we track when a user clicks on a phishing link in a simulated email. However, there are other ways a click may be registered. We refer to clicks that were not caused by a user clicking a phishing link as false positives. Listed below are some common reasons for false positives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improper whitelisting of your spam filter. Improper whitelisting can cause automated clicks or bot clicks. To learn how to tell if your click was a bot click, please see our <a href='#h_01HBVJBX3Q8HQQHBG2TN86YJPR'>How to Identify Bot Clicks</a> section below.</li>\n<li>Additional whitelisting may be required. Your spam filter may require additional whitelisting in order to exempt simulated phishing emails from link analysis or link probing.</li>\n<li>Mail filters with security add-on packs that have not been whitelisted.</li>\n<li>Endpoint security or antivirus software.</li>\n<li>Link preview functions as part of mobile device operating systems.</li>\n<li>Security software that is incorporated into mobile device management (MDM) systems.</li>\n<li>Phishing emails that are forwarded from one user to another user. This action may be registered as a click because the forwarded email was sandboxed and checked by the mail server or because the recipient of the forwarded email clicked on the link.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01HBVJBX3Q8HQQHBG2TN86YJPR'>How to Identify Bot Clicks</h2>\n<p>Instances of improper or insufficient whitelisting can lead to a bot click. Bot clicks are caused by an automated process within your infrastructure. You can identify a bot click by examining your phishing campaign results. Listed below are some ways you can identify bot clicks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The times listed in the <strong>Delivered</strong>, <strong>Open</strong>, and<strong> Click</strong> columns are all the same or are within a minute of each other.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Clicked</strong> tab indicates the browser or browser version is one that is not used in your environment or is outdated.</li>\n<li>The operating system listed is one that your users don\u2019t have access to in your environment.</li>\n<li>The IP address belongs to a provider of one of your security products.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01HBVJBX3QYH7QYSTVRBMQBX45'>Unexpected IP Addresses in Campaign Results</h2>\n<p>When a click is registered in the console, the IP address is registered from where the click originated. Below are some examples of why you may see unexpected IP addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a user is on a mobile device and clicks on the link, the click could show as coming from the cellular service provider.</li>\n<li>If a user is on the Wi-Fi in their house, the click would register as being from an IP address from that internet service provider (ISP).</li>\n<li>If a user is on public Wi-Fi, the click would register from the location of where the user was when they clicked.</li>\n<li>If you or one of your products uses a hosted services provider, such as AWS, the IP address may come from another location or even another country. Certain link analysis processes may not occur on the client side, and the link may be passed to the security provider\u2019s backend processing or analysis center.</li>\n<li>If the URL is sent to VirusTotal, the IP address may come from another location. This link may be sent automatically by a product you use or by your user. When a URL is submitted to VirusTotal, they analyze the URL to determine if it needs to be added to their threat definitions as hostile. Sometimes, this link analysis is instant. Other times, it may happen over the course of several hours. These IP addresses may register as a security vendor or they may register as an ISP.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01KAF1CSYVPF667XSSA3K6C1K3'>Common Causes of False Positives</h2>\n<p>False positives in phishing simulations typically stem from three main sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Link scanner interference</strong>: Security tools that automatically select links before users see emails</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Inadequate whitelisting</strong>: KnowBe4 domains are not properly exempted from security scanning</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Misconfigured</strong> security policies: Spam filters or mail flow rules that conflict with phishing test delivery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To minimize false positives, configure your spam filters to exclude KnowBe4 phishing emails from link analysis and probing. Ensure smart hosts and advanced delivery policies align with your campaign configurations. When investigating link scanner-related issues, review your whitelisting settings with IT admins to strike a balance between security requirements and accurate training metrics.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HBVJBX3Q60K6XWZ24ZKQYN0Y'>How to Prevent False Positives</h2>\n<p>Knowing your infrastructure is the most important step for preventing false positives. Since there are a wide variety of security software products, you may want to check the documentation of the software or service providers that you use to see if there is a section about exempting links or domains from link scanning, link analysis, or link probing.</p>\n<p>You can also run test campaigns with a couple of different templates on machines that would have the same setup as your users' workstations. These test campaigns can help you see if your current setup will cause false positives.</p>\n<p>Make sure your users are only reporting emails via the Phish Alert Button and not your mail server's phishing button or any other third-party reporting feature.</p>\n<p>Check to see if your security products have the option of additional whitelisting. If you can, whitelist our phish link domains and our landing page domains. This extra step can help prevent false positives. To see a list of our root phishing domains, navigate to the <strong>Phishing</strong> tab in your KnowBe4 console and select the <strong>Domains </strong>subtab. For more information on the <strong>Domains</strong> subtab, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360061705153.html'>How to Manage Phish Link Domains</a> article.</p>\n<p>If you are still experiencing issues with false positives, contact our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/requests/new'>support team</a> and they will be happy to assist you.</p>",

The subsections below explain how they function.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JYPBPFPRGGV4BF7AC6938CC4'>Link Rewriting\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Link rewriting functions as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When enabled, this feature modifies links in emails by redirecting them through the Defend portal.</li>\n<li>For example, a link to google.com would be rewritten to appear as \u201clinks.[region].defend.egress.com/\u201d.</li>\n<li>This rewriting allows for additional security checks when the link is clicked.</li>\n<li>Disabling link rewriting will mean that Defend does not modify the links in question. For example, a link to google.com will continue to link to google.com.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01JYPBR8E391REWH9M6E29BANG'>Link Scanning\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Link scanning functions as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disabling or enabling URL rewriting controls what checks we do when a user clicks on a rewritten link.</li>\n<li>If link rewriting is enabled, the link is \u201cfollowed\u201d to find potential link redirects, and then scans them. This feature allows Defend to do a full suite of checks, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Linguistic and contextual analysis to identify potential risks</li>\n<li>Scanning for threats utilizing techniques such as character obfuscation, suspicious domains, domain age, and potential impersonation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If link rewriting is disabled, the link is not \u201cfollowed\u201d or accessed by Defend but will still be scanned for potential threats, which include heuristic and blocklist checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01JYPBTP50N5TYH1DT4E6C36EW'>Exceptions and Configurations\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Admins can configure exceptions for specific domains to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable link rewriting.\n<ul>\n<li>When link rewriting is disabled for a domain, the original URL remains unchanged in the email.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Disable link scanning\n<ul>\n<li>When link scanning is disabled, Defend will not perform its usual security checks on that link.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01JYPBZ8N3F13ZP5VKFQY3XGP3'>One-Time Use Links\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Our link scanning breaks one-time use links, such as activation emails to register for an account. In some cases, users are given an error message stating that the link has already been used when Defend has rewritten a link. We recommend admins add a \"URL Rewriting exception\" entry for domains or services that use one-time links, which can be done in the Defend console.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEPGAC5FJ8JBWQTS2MAKR3DT'>What does Defend look for in attachments?</h2>\n<p>Defend does not rewrite the links inside attachments. We look at many components of the attachment to ascertain if the file is malicious. Defend will complete the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scan the attachments for links.</li>\n<li>Scan where those links go and if they're held on any blocklists.</li>\n<li>Scan the link text for any coercive language.</li>\n<li>Scan the URL itself for malicious information.</li>\n<li>Scan the file name and file type for sensitive information or social engineering.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Look for obfuscation of the file extension.</li>\n<li>Scan for JavaScript.</li>\n<li>Compare with known malware hashes.</li>\n<li>Use Bit-defender for AV scanning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JEPGAC5F1EC1ZDBB1Y1B2BYR'>URL Rewriting Exception List</h2>\n<p>An exception list entry can be created to avoid links being scanned or rewritten for a particular domain. This feature can also be activated to work on older URLs. If a link is deemed harmful and the continue button is disabled, admins can add the links to the rewriting exceptions. When the user then tries to navigate to the link, Defend will send them to the end destination.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEPGAC5G2YG2KFREE1YDYPCK'>URL Decoding</h2>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/egress/url_decoding.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/egress/url_decoding.png' alt='URL Decode subtab'> </a></p>\n<p>A rewritten link can be decoded in the Defend console. Admins can then click on the decoded URL to navigate to the referenced site. The ability to rewrite URLs must be enabled in the console.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEPGAC5G3VQE80MWKHEZ0REM'>Rewritten Link Expiry</h2>\n<p>Any link Defend rewrites will continue to work indefinitely, even if the organization is no longer a Defend customer.</p>",

To learn about these options, see the list below:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatically scan ALL Attachments (Hashes Only)</strong>: If you select this check box, VirusTotal will receive a hash of all attachments in your PhishER <strong>Inbox</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatically scan ALL URLs</strong>: If you select this check box, VirusTotal will automatically be sent all URLs in your PhishER Inbox.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Timeout if no response (seconds)</strong>: Enter a number of seconds to set a custom timeout period for your VirusTotal scan results. If VirusTotal does not return scan results within this timeout period, a <strong>VT_Bypassed</strong> tag will be applied to the corresponding message. By default, the timeout period is 120 seconds. To learn more about the tags that can be applied to the message, see the <a href='#h_01HSBWVDPNRWD3KHWE0CD58Y5Z'>VirusTotal Tags</a> section of this article.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ignored Domains</strong>: Enter the domains that you would like VirusTotal to ignore when running a scan. Enter each domain as a new line in the text box. If you add a domain to this list, any subdomains of that domain will be excluded as well. However, if you add a subdomain to the list, the domain will not be excluded. Wildcards (*) and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are not supported.\n<div class='callout-warning'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong>For a list of KnowBe4 domains that should not be sent as links or attachments to VirusTotal, see the <a href='#h_01HSBWVDPN1F4Q9S2RT7BVX2B8'>Excluding KnowBe4 Domains from Scans</a> section of this article.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Save</strong>: Click this button to update your VirusTotal integration settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01HSBWVDPNC5QZCCK9JJ8JRE1P'>Scanning with VirusTotal</h2>\n<p>Once you integrate your VirusTotal account with your PhishER platform, you can run a VirusTotal scan on message attachments and URLs.

You can exclude URLs by adding their domains to your <strong>Ignored Domains</strong> list. The scanned URLs and hashed attachments will be shared publicly with the scan results in the VirusTotal community to spread awareness of verified malicious content. If you manually submit a file, the entire attachment is shared publicly with the scan results. This information is important to consider when running VirusTotal scans on URLs or on attachments with sensitive information.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HSBWVDPN1F4Q9S2RT7BVX2B8'>Excluding KnowBe4 Domains from Scans</h2>\n<p>KnowBe4 uses multiple domains that should not be sent as links or attachments to VirusTotal.

Based on the scan results, VirusTotal will apply one or more of the tags to your messages. To learn about the VirusTotal tags, see the list below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>VT_Pending</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a VirusTotal scan is queued. This tag will be removed when the scan is completed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>VT_Bad</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a VirusTotal scan determines that the attachment is malicious.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>VT_Scanned</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a VirusTotal scan is completed and determined that the attachment is not malicious.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>VT_Bypassed</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a VirusTotal scan times out. This tag is commonly attached with additional VirusTotal tags. You can set a custom timeout period under your <strong>VirusTotal Automatic Scanning</strong> settings.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If a VirusTotal timeout occurs, PhishER will allow automated actions to run against the message while the console waits for your VirusTotal results to return. After the automated actions are completed, VirusTotal can finish attaching tags to the message. Automated actions will not run again after the scan results return.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>VT_Hash_not_found</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a VirusTotal scan doesn\u2019t return a match for the hashed attachments.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>VT_Ignored</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when URLs or domains found on your whitelist are detected on a message.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note: </strong>A message with multiple attachments can have multiple VT tags since some scans may finish at different times or have different results.</div>\n</div>",

When you create an export, a CSV file is created with the data that is available in your platform at the time of the export. If you make changes to your account after creating the export, the CSV file will not reflect these changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Question:</strong>Why isn't the data in my CSV file in the same order as the data in my KCM GRC account? <strong>Answer:</strong> When you open your CSV file in a spreadsheet program, the order of the data may not match the order of the data in your account. We recommend sorting your spreadsheet alphabetically before reviewing your data. If you'd like to compare your CSV file to the data in your account, you can alphabetically sort both your spreadsheet and your data in KCM GRC.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Question:</strong> Why aren't my special characters showing correctly when I open my CSV file in Microsoft Excel?\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If your export contains characters from East Asian languages, they may not display properly in your CSV file. Make sure to turn on the East Asian language features in Excel. To learn more, see Microsoft's <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-on-east-asian-language-features-in-office-for-mac-40db0d4f-4bad-47d3-9eeb-bf80f9c3b5b1' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Turn on East Asian language features in Office for Mac</a> article.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

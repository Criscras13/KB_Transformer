  "body": "\n<p>Within Microsoft's Defender security platform, organizations can run phishing simulations as part of their security awareness training for end users. These simulation emails are generated within the organization\u2019s tenancy and directly injected into users' inboxes, bypassing the Microsoft Exchange transport layer. Consequently, these phishing simulations do not pass through Defend and thus do not display any Defend banners.</p>\n<p>To address this, you can manually insert the raw HTML code for a Defend banner into the phishing simulation emails during their creation. The necessary HTML code can be obtained from support. Follow the steps in this guide to integrate the Defend banners into these simulation emails.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEXN3SXV4E7SQ7PXAEA8P8S8'>Requirements</h2>\n<p>The following items are required...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2</li>\n<li>Defend subscription</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JEXN3SXVJY9RPC6YAMGJ96AK'>Integration Steps</h2>\n<p>Follow the steps below to integrate...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to Microsoft's Attack Simulator.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to <strong>Simulations Launch a simulation</strong>.

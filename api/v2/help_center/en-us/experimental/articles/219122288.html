  "body": "<p>The Phish Alert Button (PAB) is a tool that allows you to report suspicious emails. When you select the PAB, you can help warn your IT security team about <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/phishing' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>phishing attacks</a> or malicious messages.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HNDDWJ52392GJ9PCSNMNTDV0'>Why Use the PAB</h2>\n<p>Reporting emails will help your organization stay safe. Because the potential phishing emails you report are sent to your organization for analysis, your organization will be aware of which phishing attacks are able to reach their users' inboxes. Once everyone is aware of possible vulnerabilities, they can better defend against cyber attacks. You are an important part of the process of keeping your organization safe from cybercriminals. Stop, look, and think!</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HNDDWJ52K0BN0VCC5FJ09XZ4'>When to Use the PAB</h2>\n<p>You should use the PAB any time you receive an email that is suspicious or a potential phishing attack.</p>\n<p>You can use the PAB to report various types of suspicious emails, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Phishing attempts:</strong> Emails designed to steal credentials or sensitive information</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Spam:</strong> Unwanted or unsolicited marketing emails</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Unknown threats:</strong> Any email that seems suspicious, but you're unsure of the specific threat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When reporting an email, you'll be able to classify it appropriately so that your IT security team can prioritize their response.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HNDDWJ527K3DM787DZSRM5KK'>How to Use the PAB</h2>\n<p>Once your organization has installed the PAB for Outlook, you should see the PAB in your inbox. Depending on your version of Outlook, the PAB displays as a button in the app launcher or a button at the top of your Outlook client.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong>When you report an email with the PAB, the email may be forwarded to your IT security team and will be deleted from your inbox. If you reported the email by mistake, you can recover the email from your <strong>Trash</strong> folder or your <strong>Deleted Items</strong>.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01HNDDWJ52T9M69883RSS4WJ5S'>Reporting Emails with the PAB Icon</h3>\n<p>To report an email with the <strong>PAB</strong> icon at the top of your Outlook client, follow the steps below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/phish_alert/outlook.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/phish_alert/outlook.png' alt=' ' width='600' height='370'></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your Outlook client.</li>\n<li>Select or open the email that you would like to report.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Phish Alert</strong> button at the top of the page.</li>\n<li>In the pop-up window that opens, select the <strong>Phish Alert</strong> button to report the email.</li>\n</ol>",

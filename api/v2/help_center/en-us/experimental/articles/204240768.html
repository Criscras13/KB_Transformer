You can then use these templates and landing pages in phishing campaigns to test your users. To learn more about creating phishing templates and landing pages, read the sections below or watch our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009600648'>Customization of Phishing Templates and Landing Pages</a> video.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HJKER2NQA412R6J3NTA9DY01'>Creating and Editing Phishing Templates</h2>\n<p>In your KnowBe4 console, you can create and edit phishing templates. To create or edit a template, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>In your KnowBe4 console, navigate to <strong>Phishing</strong> &gt; <strong>Phishing Templates</strong> &gt; <strong>My Templates</strong>.</li>\n<li>To create a new phishing template, click the <strong>+Create Template</strong> button. To edit an existing template, click the name of that template.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you click the <strong>+Create Template</strong> button or the name of an existing template, the template editor will open. From here, you can create or edit the template.

While this is an optional step, templates with a language selected are available for use in localized phishing campaigns.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> When copying a system or community template, this field will populate with the language that template uses.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Template Name</strong>: Enter a name for your template in this field. The name you choose will not be visible to your users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sender's Email Address</strong>: Enter an email address to show who sent the email.

User replies will be sent to this email address unless reply-to phishing is enabled. When using reply-to phishing, this email address will be overwritten by our system-generated email address so that we can capture replies. For more information on reply-to phishing, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/234956728'>Reply-To Phishing</a> article.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reply-To Name </strong>(Optional): Enter a name you would like to have users see when replying to a simulated phishing test. When a user replies to this email, the <strong>To</strong> field will automatically populate with the name you entered in this field.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Subject</strong>: Enter the subject line that your users will see in their inboxes. This field will be used as the template\u2019s name if you do not enter a template name.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Attachment File Name </strong>(Optional): Enter a name for any attachments you would like to use in your email.

You can also add alternative text here for accessibility.\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong> When resizing images, always edit the width and height in the image's style tag.

For steps on how to create a phishing link, follow these steps:\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>In the text field, enter the text you want to make into a phishing link. Then, highlight the text and click the <strong>Phish Link</strong> button to turn it into a phishing link. If you create an HTML link in a phishing template, our system will automatically change the link to a phishing link for security purposes. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishingTemplates/Red_Flags.gif'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishingTemplates/Red_Flags.gif' alt=''></a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>QR Code:</strong> Click the <strong>QR Code</strong> button to add a QR code to your phishing template.

The What You See Is What You Get (WSYWIG) editor provides options for customizing your phishing template. You can add tables, lines, and more by using the buttons available in the WYSIWYG editor.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Landing Page:</strong> Select a landing page from the drop-down menu. This page is where your users will be redirected if they fail a phishing test. You can choose from our system landing pages or your custom landing pages.\u00a0\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>If you select a landing page when creating a phishing campaign, it will override the template you created/edited and the default landing page.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Landing Domain</strong>: Select a web address from the drop-down menu that the user will see on the landing page. Changing the landing domain can be helpful if you are also using one of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204446387'>Data Entry</a> landing pages. You can set a default landing domain on your <strong>Account Settings</strong> page, which will apply to all email templates you create.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Difficulty Rating</strong>: You can assign a difficulty rating to your custom phishing templates. The difficulty rating will show how difficult that particular phishing template will be for your users to identify. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/218333717'>Template Difficulty Ratings Overview</a> article.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your new template will be saved in the <strong>My Templates</strong> section.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HKDBF195YSAJDGCWC2C0DDH2'>Previewing and Testing Templates</h3>\n<p>After you have created a template, you may find it useful to preview the template so that you can see what it will look like for your users.</p>\n<p>To preview a template, navigate to <strong>Phishing </strong>&gt;<strong> Phishing Templates</strong> &gt; <strong>My Templates</strong> and click the <strong>Preview</strong> icon under the <strong>Actions</strong> column for that template.</p>\n<p>While previewing a template, you can also use the <strong>Send Me a Test Email</strong> button to send a copy of the template to your inbox as an email. This feature is useful when creating your own phishing templates since it will allow you to see what the email will look like before sending it to your users in a phishing campaign.</p>\n<p>We do not recommend using the <strong>Send Me a Test Email</strong> button to test your whitelisting. The email that is sent using this button will look like a phishing test email but will not have the same functionality as an email sent from a phishing campaign. Instead, we recommend setting up a <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/206523288#h_01GTEV7Z9715EJBJZEV4D9VQT1'>preliminary test campaign</a> to ensure the most accurate testing results.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HJKER2NQQDQSP9Q2WHTM1XKA'>Creating and Editing Landing Pages</h2>\n<p>In your KnowBe4 console, you can create and edit landing pages.

Instead of embedding your images or uploading your images for us to host, using the linking method serves two mutually beneficial purposes. First, we provide a means for you to make more realistic templates that may help preserve the integrity and proportions of the images that you add to your templates. Second, linking your images decreases the amount of content you have to share with us to achieve the same outcome as uploading your images to the console.</p>",

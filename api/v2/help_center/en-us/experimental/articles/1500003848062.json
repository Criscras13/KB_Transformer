All accounts will be opted in to phishing template advanced features in 2025. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410161863955'>Phishing Templates Advanced Features Guide</a>.</div></div><p>When creating a phishing campaign, you have the option to use one of our <strong>Automated Template Selections </strong>to automatically select the templates used in your campaign. Automated template selections choose templates from topics you select and add variety to recurring phishing campaigns.</p><p>The three automated template selection options are <strong>AI-selected</strong> (Diamond-level customers only), <strong>Full Random</strong>, and <strong>Random</strong>. Click on the tabs below to learn more about each option.</p><div class='js-tabs'>\n<div title='AIDA Selected'>\n<h3 id='h_01HKDJW9256AE0HH58X4ZENT0A'>AI-selected Phishing Templates</h3>\n<p>Diamond-level customers have the option to use <strong>AI-selected</strong> phishing templates. This feature uses data from KnowBe4\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Defense Agents (AIDA) to select the most relevant and challenging template for each user. AI-selected templates are chosen based on a user\u2019s training history, phishing events, and performance metrics, such as their Phish-prone percentage and Security Awareness Proficiency Assessment (SAPA) results. The more data AIDA has, the better it works, so we recommend using these templates for users who have some prior training or phishing history.</p>\n<p>To avoid repetition in recurring campaigns, the AI-selected feature remembers the last five emails sent to each user and selects a different template for subsequent tests.</p>\n<p>When using AI-selected templates, choose multiple topics to ensure you have a minimum of 20 templates. Providing a large number of templates for AIDA to choose from allows for more variety in your campaign. For best results, we recommend using 50 templates or more.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/aidaselecteddropdown2.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/aidaselecteddropdown2.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n</div>\n<div title='Full Random'>\n<h3 id='h_01HKDJW926SVX6NEG6BJ1XY1T2'>Full Random (Random Email to Each User)</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Full Random</strong> option automatically chooses different templates for each user by pulling from the selected topics. Users enrolled in the campaign will receive a variety of different emails. Using Full Random is a great way to prevent users from telling each other about an incoming phishing test. For an even more effective test, we recommend sending the emails over a period of time.</p>\n<div class='callout callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> To prevent users from getting the same phishing templates too often, the <strong>Full Random</strong> option skips the five most recently used phishing templates that were sent to each user.</div></div>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/fullrandomdropdown2.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/fullrandomdropdown2.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n</div>\n<div title='Random'>\n<h3 id='h_01HKDJW926N2J8WJY2BKH6VYMV'>Random (Same random email to all users)</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Random</strong> option will automatically choose one template from the selected topics.

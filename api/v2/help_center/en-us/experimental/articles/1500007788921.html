When you create an export, a CSV file is created with the data that is available in your platform at the time of the export. If you make changes to your account after creating the export, the CSV file will not reflect these changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Question:</strong>Why isn't the data in my CSV file in the same order as the data in my KCM GRC account? <strong>Answer:</strong> When you open your CSV file in a spreadsheet program, the order of the data may not match the order of the data in your account. We recommend sorting your spreadsheet alphabetically before reviewing your data. If you'd like to compare your CSV file to the data in your account, you can alphabetically sort both your spreadsheet and your data in KCM GRC.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Question:</strong> Why aren't my special characters showing correctly when I open my CSV file in Microsoft Excel?\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If your export contains characters from East Asian languages, they may not display properly in your CSV file. Make sure to turn on the East Asian language features in Excel. To learn more, see Microsoft's <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-on-east-asian-language-features-in-office-for-mac-40db0d4f-4bad-47d3-9eeb-bf80f9c3b5b1' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Turn on East Asian language features in Office for Mac</a> article.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

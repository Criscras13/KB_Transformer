After a failure is removed, your KSAT account may take up to 15 minutes to update your reports.</p>\n<p>Email opens are not considered a failure on a phishing test and do not contribute to a user's Phish-prone Percentage.</p>\n<p>There are two methods you can use to remove phishing test failures. You can either remove failures from <a href='#01H8F8W7493BJJMJ9HZ6W79NZK'>the phishing campaign's report</a> or from the <a href='#01H8F8W749Q34EW0MYHQKFS7C2'>affected user's timeline</a>.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>Within your <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204239938' target='_self'>phishing campaign settings</a>, you can choose to automatically add users who fail the phishing test to a group. If you chose this option when you created the campaign and would like to remove a failure from this campaign, removing the failure will not remove the failing user from the group. You can manually remove the user if you would like. However, if you are using a Smart Group to group your users, the group will update to reflect the failure removal.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8F8W7493BJJMJ9HZ6W79NZK'>Remove a Failure from the Phishing Campaign Report</h2>\n<p>You can remove phishing test failures from a phishing campaign report individually or in bulk.</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT account and navigate to <strong>Phishing </strong>&gt;<strong> Campaigns</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n<li>From the list of phishing campaigns, click the campaign that you would like to remove a failure from. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/phishing_failures/remove_failures_01.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/phishing_failures/remove_failures_01.png' alt=' ' width='754' height='270'></a>\n</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Users</strong> subtab.</li>\n<li>Click on the column header for the type of failure you want to remove.

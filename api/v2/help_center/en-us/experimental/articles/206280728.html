Assigning remedial training to these users will provide them with extra training that will help improve their security awareness.</p>\n<p>To assign remedial training to your users, you will need to create a remedial training group, a remedial training campaign, and a phishing campaign. When users fail a phishing test from this phishing campaign, they will be enrolled in the remedial training campaign.</p>\n<p>Click the links below to learn how to set up a remedial training campaign. If you prefer video tutorials, you can also watch our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8592648153107.html'>Automating Remedial Training with Smart Groups</a> video.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> If you're a Platinum or Diamond customer, you can use our Smart Groups feature to automatically add users to or remove users from remedial training based on specific criteria, such as the number of phishing failures or training assignments completed.

We also recommend you select the\u00a0<strong>Allow assignments to be completed after due date</strong> checkbox.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content</strong>: From the drop-down menu, select the training content that you would like to add to your remedial training campaign.

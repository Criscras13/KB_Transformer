  "body": "<p>When you create a phishing campaign, you have the option to test your users with QR codes. QR codes, or quick response codes, are scannable barcodes that contain data in a compact format. QR codes can include data such as a link to a website, a location on a map, or a digital business card. If your users scan a malicious barcode, they could be prompted to visit a dangerous website. Additionally, malicious links hidden in QR codes may be able to bypass your organization's security filters.</p>\n<p>QR code Phishing Security Tests (PSTs) can help prepare your users for real QR code phishing attacks. For example, your users may be used to using a QR code to view the online menu at their favorite restaurant. Unfortunately, not all QR codes are safe to scan. Using QR code phishing, you can train your users to spot fake QR codes.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HQR2V1EDS5ATA0GJ3A3B7CFD'>Creating a QR Code Phishing Campaign</h2>\n<p>You can create a QR code phishing campaign from the <strong>Phishing</strong> tab of your KSAT console.

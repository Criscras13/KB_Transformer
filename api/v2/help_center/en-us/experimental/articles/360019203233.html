  "body": "<p>If you've administered mandatory training for any organization, you've likely run into a user or two who didn't complete their training on time. When using the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360014116634.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Learner Experience (LX)</a> to conduct training, there are a few options for allowing users to complete their assignments after the deadline. You can extend a specific user\u2019s due date, allow training to be completed after the due date, or extend a training campaign\u2019s due date.</p>\n<p>You can decide which option is best for your organization. Depending on the nature of the training content and the culture of your organization, one option may be more beneficial than the other.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id='h_01GQT7WPA6K9RVHR2E738FT8AM'>Extending Specific User's Due Date</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re in a high-risk industry, or if your organization handles sensitive information, you may have to enforce strict deadlines for employee training assignments. If this describes your organization, then we recommend extending the user due date. This is a more hands-on approach, allowing more control over the due date extension. You\u2019ll set a new due date for one or more users and send them manual notifications from the console to inform them their training has been extended. You can also send an email notification to the user, their manager, and the account admins.</p>\n<p>To extend a user's due date, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li aria-level='1'>From the <strong>Training </strong>tab of your KSAT console, click on the <strong>Campaigns</strong> subtab.</li>\n<li aria-level='1'>Click on the name of the desired training campaign.\u00a0</li>\n<li aria-level='1'>From the campaign\u2019s overview page, click on the <strong>Users</strong> subtab.\u00a0\n<ul role='list'>\n<li aria-level='2'>Alternatively, you can click on a <strong>User Progress </strong>button beneath the title of a piece of content. On the user progress page, you will only be able to update the due date for that specific training assignment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li aria-level='1'>From the <strong>Users</strong> tab or the user progress page, click on the <strong>Past Due</strong> subtab.</li>\n<li aria-level='1'>Find the desired user or users that need a due date extension on their content. Then, select the check box to the left of the content to extend the due date. If you're on the user progress page, select the check box to the left of the desired users.\n<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/PastDueTraining/ExtendUser_Step3and4.png'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/PastDueTraining/ExtendUser_Step3and4.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li aria-level='1'>Click the <strong>Actions</strong> drop-down button.

For more information about training notifications, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010848868.html'>Training Campaign Notifications</a><span> article. You can also send notifications with the [[extended_due_date]] placeholder to inform users of the new due date. You can use our system templates or customize your own training notifications. See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204949707.html'>How to Use Placeholders</a><span> article for more information on training notification placeholders. </span></span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id='h_01GQT9T6FCFANGVAFF2B7AT481'>Allowing Training to Be Completed After Due Date</h2>\n<p>If your organization takes more of a casual approach to employee training, or if the training content is beneficial but not necessarily required of your industry or position, then we recommend allowing assignments to be completed after the due date. This permits users to access and complete their training at any time after the due date. To encourage users to complete their training, you\u2019ll set up automated notifications for users who have missed the deadline, and you\u2019ll specify how often they receive these reminders.</p>\n<p>When a training campaign has a specific end date or occurs on a relative duration schedule, you can allow users to complete training assignments after their original due date.\u00a0You can also customize an automated schedule for sending <strong>Past Due</strong> notifications to users, their managers, and KSAT account admins, to ensure training is completed.</p>\n<p>To allow users who miss their training deadline to still take their training, select the <strong>Allow assignments to be completed after due date</strong> check box. You can apply this setting when creating a new campaign, or when editing an existing campaign.</p>\n<p>When you enable this setting for a campaign, a clock icon is displayed next to the campaign dates to indicate that users are allowed to complete their training after the deadline (<a href='#!' data-toggle='modal' data-target='#myModal'>click to view</a>).<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PastDueTraining/AllowAssignments_OnCampaign.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PastDueTraining/AllowAssignments_OnCampaign.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<div class=''>\n<div id='myModal' class='modal fade'>\n<div class='modal-dialog'>\n<div class='modal-content'>\n<div class='modal-header'>\n<button class='close' type='button' data-dismiss='modal'>\u00d7</button>\n<h4 id='h_01HAQ2R04XJKM0682TME9X9H14' class='modal-title'>Clock Icon</h4>\n</div>\n<div class='modal-body'>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/training+course+mgmt/pastdue_icon.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/training+course+mgmt/pastdue_icon.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class='modal-footer'><button class='btn btn-default' type='button' data-dismiss='modal'>Close</button></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class='callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>When enabling this setting, it's important to add <strong>Past Due</strong> notifications to your campaign.

Changing the campaign's end date will not affect users who have already completed their training.</p>\n<p>If you decide that changing the campaign end date is the best option to handle past-due users, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li aria-level='1'>Navigate to the <strong>Training </strong> section of your KSAT account.</li>\n<li aria-level='1'>From the <strong>Campaigns</strong> tab, click the drop-down arrow to the far-right of the training campaign.

We suggest using manual notifications instead.</p>\n<p>You can add additional automated notifications to a campaign at any time.

  "body": "<p>In your KCM GRC platform, your scopes will include a set of requirements. You can map these requirements to controls to demonstrate how your organization meets its various compliance requirements. For more information about scopes, requirements, and controls, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115016129608' target='_self'>Glossary of Compliance Terms</a>.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Under the Risk Management module, you can use also map controls to risks to document the preventative measures that your organization is using to defend against risks.

If you're just getting started with KCM GRC and you've only created a small number of scopes, mapping controls to requirements may be the easier option for you. If you've created multiple scopes that have requirements, we recommend mapping requirements to controls instead.</p>\n<p>See the sections below to learn how to map controls to requirements, map requirements to controls, and unmap requirements and controls.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HVPBEHG9B3EPWWA196PRF949'>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before you can map requirements and controls, you will need to complete the actions listed below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Create a scope that contains a set of requirements. You can create a scope by converting a managed template or a custom template into a scope.

These types of attacks work by tricking your user into completing a task for someone they think is one of their co-workers or even a C-level executive, but is actually an imposter. This task could be anything, from providing sensitive information to wiring money. PRT can help you see how likely your users would be to fall for this type of attack should a real attack ever occur.</p>\n<p>PRT allows you to send your users one of three pre-built phishing templates and tracks how many users reply. <strong>PRT will <em>never</em> save any of the information included in a reply. We only track whether the user replied, not the contents of that reply.</strong> We recommend spoofing someone from your own organization for more accurate results but make sure you get their permission first.</p>\n<p>Follow these steps below to complete your free PRT. You will not be required to download or install any software. The default test is limited to 100 employees. Please contact us if you need to send to more.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HSE8Z49GDG7RG4XN43SZDBJQ'>Signing Up for a Free Account</h2>\n<p>If you already have a free account, skip to the <a href='#h_01HSE8Z49GWDA8W7E5SXZN1SQ7'>Setting Up a Phishing Reply Test</a> section.</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Sign up for a free account here: <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/phishing-reply-test' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>KnowBe4 Free Phishing Reply Test</a>.</li>\n<li>After entering your information, you can either click <strong>Get Started</strong> or click the link provided in the email we will send you.</li>\n<li>On the next page, you'll be prompted to enter your work email address.

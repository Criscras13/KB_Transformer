  "body": "<p>When you create a phishing campaign, you can choose one of our pre-made landing pages or customize your own landing page. We offer several different types of landing pages to fit your organization\u2019s needs. To view all the landing pages we offer, log in to your KnowBe4 console and navigate to <strong>Phishing</strong> &gt; <strong>Landing Pages</strong> &gt; <strong>System Categories</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this article, you will learn about some of our most popular landing page categories along with the benefits of using these landing pages. For a full list of all our landing page categories, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360036273333.html' target='_self'>Landing Page Category Glossary</a>. For general information about using landing pages, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204240768.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Edit Email Templates and Landing Pages</a> and <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/15946120955411.html' target='_self'>How to Manage Your Email Templates and Landing Pages</a> articles.</p>\n\n<h2 id='h_01FX83C9ETH46HDCADMRVEHGQ1'>Generic Landing Pages</h2>\n<p>Many of our generic landing pages inform users that they've failed a test and provide users with tips for staying safe from future phishing attacks. One of our most popular generic landing pages is our <strong>Basic Oops! Landing Page</strong>. This landing page notifies users that they\u2019ve clicked on a simulated phishing test and includes three rules for staying safe online.<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/landing_pages/landingpages_basicoops.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/landing_pages/landingpages_basicoops.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n\n<p>The benefit of using these types of landing pages is that your users will learn that they failed the phishing test and how to avoid future phishing attacks. However, these landing pages are less discrete than some of our other landing pages such as our <a href='#h_01FX83CM9DT0ED9KQR0EG6D1T7' target='_self'>error page landing pages</a>. If you set your phishing test to be sent to all users at the same time, users who fail the test may see this landing page and notify other users that your organization is conducting a phishing test.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id='h_01FX83CF0QGSFE11BGSKE0XM3B'>Social Engineering Indicators (SEI) Landing Pages</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re a Platinum or Diamond customer, you can use our SEI landing pages to alert users about the red flags they may have missed in the phishing email. Your users can hover over the red flags on the landing page to learn more about each red flag and how to watch out for similar red flags in future emails.<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/landing_pages/landingpages_SEI.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/landing_pages/landingpages_SEI.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id='h_01FX83CM9DT0ED9KQR0EG6D1T7'>Error Page Landing Pages</h2>\n<p>We also offer several error page landing pages. These landing pages look like popular error pages, such as \u201c404 Not Found\u201d error pages.<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/landing_pages/landingpages_404error.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/landing_pages/landingpages_404error.png' width='619' height='325' alt=' '></a></p>\n\n<p>The benefit of using error page landing pages is that your users will be less likely to warn other users about the phishing test since the landing page is discrete. However, your users may reach out to your IT team for support if they believe they\u2019ve been directed to a real error page.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>If you would like, you can create a custom landing page with a message that informs users that they do not need to contact your IT team about the error. For example, you could customize your landing page to say \u201cPlease disregard the message from IT. The security event has been addressed.\u201d For more information about customizing landing pages, see\u00a0our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204240768.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Edit Email Templates and Landing Pages</a> and <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/15946120955411.html' target='_self'>How to Manage Your Email Templates and Landing Pages</a> articles.</div></div>\n\n\n<h2 id='h_01FX83CS0TDGPNT00SW1T82ZWZ'>Phishing for Sensitive Information Landing Pages</h2>\n<p>If you use our phishing for sensitive information landing pages, your users will be directed to a page that resembles a legitimate data entry page. Many of these landing pages are discrete and spoof common authentication or login pages, such as Gmail or Microsoft 365 login pages.</p>\n<p>These landing pages test how likely your users are to click on a phishing link and enter sensitive information into a landing page.

The overall theme uses dark mode aesthetics.\n\n**Structure and Content:**\n\nEach of the four sections follows an identical structure:\n\n1.  **Header:** \"Threat Remediation\" followed by a question mark icon (indicating contextual help).\n2.  **Subheader:** \"Message Property Filters - Select all for exact email match\".\n3.  **Property Filters:** A row of selectable properties, presented as pills with checkboxes (or radio buttons) indicating selection status:\n    *   Attachment Name\n    *   Body\n    *   Display Name\n    *   From Address\n    *   Subject\n4.  **Confidence Metric:** A section labeled \"Email Match Confidence\" followed by an information icon, displaying a percentage and a confidence rating.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of Sections (Confidence Metrics):**\n\n| Section | Property Filter Status | Email Match Confidence | Confidence Rating |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Top** | All five properties selected (checked). | **100%** | **High** |\n| **Second** | 'Attachment Name' deselected. Others selected. | **87.5%** | **High** |\n| **Third** | 'Display Name' and 'From Address' deselected. 'Attachment Name' and 'Body' selected. | **67.5%** | **Medium** |\n| **Bottom** | 'Attachment Name', 'Body', 'Display Name', and 'From Address' deselected. Only 'Subject' selected. | **35%** | **Low** |\n\n**Inferred Context:**\n\nThe image illustrates a functional relationship where the selection of more message properties for an \"exact email match\" correlates directly with an increase in the calculated \"Email Match Confidence\" percentage and corresponding rating (Low, Medium, High). The confidence percentage decreases incrementally as fewer properties are selected.",

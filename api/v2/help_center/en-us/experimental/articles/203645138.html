  "body": "<p>Before you can begin phishing and training your users, you'll need to whitelist KnowBe4 to ensure that our training notifications and simulated phishing security tests (PSTs) successfully reach your users' inboxes. If you don't whitelist our emails properly, they may be blocked or filtered by your mail server or spam filter.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>For Microsoft 365 users, we recommend Microsoft's advanced delivery policies feature. Advanced Delivery bypasses some of Microsoft's security configurations and allows you to create a secure connection for phishing simulations.

When you whitelist our emails, we recommend that you follow the best practices listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404511190803'>advanced delivery policies</a> in addition to a spam filter, we recommend you use <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000568187'>smart hosting</a> instead of whitelisting your spam filter. Adding a smart host connection will help prevent false positives in your PSTs.</li>\n<li>If you don't have a cloud-based spam filter, we recommend that you whitelist either our IP addresses or our hostnames in your mail server. For information about whitelisting your mail server, see the <a href='#h_01HGZXM0S84QV60SNZW8V5J56E'>Whitelist Your Mail Servers</a> section below.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>You don't need to whitelist both IP addresses and hostnames.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>If you have a cloud-based spam filter, we recommend that you whitelist by email header in your mail server and whitelist by IP address or hostname in your spam filter.

Then, you or the users in the campaign will need to confirm that you've received the PST from the campaign.

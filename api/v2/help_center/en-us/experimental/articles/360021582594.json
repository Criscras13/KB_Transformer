  "body": "<p>In the KCM GRC Vendor Risk Management module, you can centralize your third-party risk management processes. You can use questionnaires to determine the level of risk that vendors and third parties pose for your organization. Questionnaires can help you learn about the vendor or third party and the amount of data they will need to access.</p>\n<p>Before you can send questionnaires to your users, you will need to create and configure the questionnaires in your platform. To create a questionnaire, you can add questions from our questionnaire templates or add your own custom questions.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> As a best practice, we recommend that you create questionnaires as the first step of onboarding in the Vendor Risk Management module. For the full list of recommended steps for working in this module, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021083194' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Vendor Risk Management Module Guide</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>See the sections below to learn how to create, configure, finalize, and clone questionnaire assessments.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 id='h_01HVVY2G0E3FTC1PM9VJJMN9MV'>What Type of Questionnaire Should I Create?</h2>\n<p>As part of your vendor or third-party risk management program, you will need to identify the types of questionnaires you want to create. You should base your questionnaires on the requirements your organization needs to meet, the frameworks your organization needs to follow, and the types of data your vendors may need to access.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> The data that your vendors will have access to will affect the level of risk that working with the vendors will pose for your organization. For example, an IT contractor who has more access to your organization\u2019s data would likely pose a higher level of risk than an organization that you lease printers from.</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you need help deciding which questionnaire template to use, Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) questionnaires are more general than Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaires (CAIQ). CAIQ questionnaires are more specific for vendors that offer cloud services. The Full versions of these questionnaires cover a wider range of topics than the Lite versions of questionnaires. If you think that the level of risk associated with a vendor will be low, you may determine that you only need to use the Lite version. However, if you think that the level of risk associated with a vendor will be moderate or high, you may determine that you need to use a Full version. If you're unsure what types of data the organization will need to access and can't predict the level of risk associated with the vendor, the Full version of a questionnaire may help you gain a more comprehensive understanding than the Lite version.</p>\n\n<h2 id='h_01HVVY2G0E0HQHT1E9JAG9WKCB'>Creating Questionnaires</h2>\n<p>After you have decided what type of questionnaire to create, you can create your questionnaire from the <strong>Questionnaires</strong> tab of your platform.</p>\n<p>To create a questionnaire, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>From your navigation panel, navigate to\u00a0<strong>Vendor Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Questionnaires</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Create New Questionnaire</strong> button at the top-right corner of the page.\n<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/KCM/KCMVendor/Vendor_Create_Questionnaires/VendorQuest_CreateButton.png'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/KCM/KCMVendor/Vendor_Create_Questionnaires/VendorQuest_CreateButton.png' width='408' height='274' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>Fill out the fields on the <strong>New Questionnaire</strong> page.

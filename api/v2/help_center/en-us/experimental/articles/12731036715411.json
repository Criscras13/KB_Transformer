After you select this check box and save your <strong>Account Settings</strong>, you'll have access to a new <strong>Provisioning</strong> subtab. To access this subtab in your console, navigate to <strong>Users </strong>&gt; <strong>Provisioning</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Test Mode:</strong> This check box is selected by default. We recommend that you keep this check box selected until you\u2019re satisfied with the results of your sync.

To see these details, navigate to <strong>Users</strong> &gt; <strong>Provisioning</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Active Directory Integration Settings:</strong> Select <strong>Active Directory Integration (ADI)</strong> to show this menu and see options for syncing with ADI.\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Show Group Domain:</strong> If your users are split between multiple domain sources, you can select this check box to add the root domain to each of the AD-synced group names in the KSAT console. Adding the root domain allows you to better organize your users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>ADI Sync Token:</strong> This is the unique account token you'll need during the ADI installation process.

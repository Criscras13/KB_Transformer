      "alt": "This image depicts a four-part process flow diagram focused on requirements management and workflow control, branded by \"KCM WORKFLOW.\"\n\n**Structure and Color Coding:**\nThe diagram uses color to denote process stages: Mustard Yellow (Input/Source), Light Blue (Scoping/Refinement), and Dark Green (Control/Execution).\n\n**Top Flow (Definition Phase):**\n1.  **Stage 1 (Mustard Yellow):** Titled **Template** (with a document and shield icon). This stage produces the initial output, labeled **Requirements** (in a white, rounded pill container, accompanied by a checklist icon). A right-pointing chevron connects this stage to the next.\n2.  **Stage 2 (Light Blue):** Titled **Scope** (with an umbrella icon). This stage refines the input, resulting in the output labeled **Scoped Requirements** (in a white, rounded pill container, accompanied by an umbrella over a checklist icon). A downward-pointing chevron connects this stage to the control blocks below.\n\n**Bottom Flow (Execution and Control Phase):**\nThe diagram proceeds to three identical, stacked, horizontal green blocks, suggesting parallel or repeatable control operations.\n*   **Control Element:** Each green block features the label **Control** (with a gear icon).\n*   **Deliverable Element:** Adjacent to the Control element is a secondary green-and-white pill container labeled **Task Schedules** (with a grid/schedule icon).\n\n**Branding:**\nThe lower-left quadrant of the image contains the company logo: **KCM WORKFLOW**. The \"M\" in KCM features a small orange checkmark or caret at its apex.",

With AIDA, you can significantly reduce your organization\u2019s risk and demonstrate positive impacts on real-world user behavior.</p><p>AIDA will continue to evolve over time, providing new ways to reach your goals. AIDA is available on the KnowBe4 console as an add-on to your Diamond-level subscription.</p><h2 id='h_01K09VP1X5SHKAXF024TGP6EF9'>How AIDA Works</h2><p>AIDA is built on a strong and flexible foundation, using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to power its core features. Think of this foundation like a house that can easily be expanded as needed. AIDA uses special programs called Anthropic Claude models for its main creative AI abilities. For other specific tasks, we use our own unique algorithms.</p><p>We teach our AI models using smart techniques, allowing them to learn from a few examples. This technique helps them to produce accurate and specific results.</p><p>We are committed to using AI responsibly. This commitment means we work hard to make sure our technology is fair and doesn't reflect human-like biases.</p><p>We use AI by carefully training our models and setting up safety measures. These safety measures act like guardrails to prevent the AI from making things up, sometimes called \"hallucinations\", or causing other mistakes. This measure ensures our AI tools are dependable and trustworthy.</p><p>Refer to the sections below to learn more about <a href='#h_01J29X7371VA5ZR3M3H7W334QV'>AIDA Template Generation</a>, <a href='#h_01J29X8BRZ9MJ36VWZ70Q55HY5'>AIDA Automated Training</a>, <a href='#h_01J29X8V4M9PEZM3BCYFZ8EXAN'>AIDA Policy Quizzes</a>, and <a href='#h_01J29X8XSX7JRT49R1C7CP6G62'>AIDA Knowledge Refreshers</a>.</p><div class='callout-tip'><div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>To view an AIDA product demo, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000937648'>KnowBe4 Product Demos</a> article.</div></div><h2 id='h_01J29X7371VA5ZR3M3H7W334QV'>AIDA Template Generation</h2><p>Use AIDA to create custom phishing and callback phishing templates on demand based on your specifications.

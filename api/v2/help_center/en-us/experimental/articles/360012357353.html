Control Objective: User Access Reviews for all Internal Software Programs**\n*   **Description:** Mandates separate tasks for access reviews across internal software, listing three example systems: `Gsuite`, `HR Employee Managment Software`, and `Document Sharing software (Docuphase)`.\n*   **Assignment Metadata:**\n    *   `User/Group Assigned:` Red status badge displaying `Not Assigned`.\n    *   `Manager:` Green status badge displaying `Jane Doe`.\n*   **Tasks Panel:** A second collapsible panel titled `Tasks` displays four status badges:\n    *   `Closed/Failed: Dec 28, 2020` (Red).\n    *   `Closed/Failed: Jan 4, 2021` (Red).\n    *   `Pending/Success: Dec 29, 2020` (Teal).\n    *   `Closed/Late: Nov 25, 2020` (Green).\n\nThe consistent UI uses color-coded badges (Red for failure/missing assignment, Amber for missing manager, Green for success, Teal for pending) to indicate assignment and task completion status and dates.",

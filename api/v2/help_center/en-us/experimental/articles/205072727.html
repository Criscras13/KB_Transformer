  "body": "<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>We\u2019ve added advanced features to phishing templates! All accounts will be opted in to phishing template advanced features in 2025.\u00a0For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410161863955'>Phishing Templates Advanced Features Guide</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>The answer to this question can vary on a case-by-case basis. However, as a general best practice, we recommend using a template that is generic and can apply to each individual in your organization. We also recommend that you send the same template to all users at once for your baseline test.</p>\n<p>Depending on the type of setup your organization has or any particular vulnerability that has been exposed in the past, you may wish to make your own custom email. You can also choose one of the many templates included in the <strong>System Templates</strong> area. For some generic templates that might be the right choice for you, check out our <strong>Baseline Templates</strong> category under <strong>System Templates</strong>.</p>\n<p>We do suggest two basic templates that will work for most organizations: the <strong>Change of Password Required Immediately</strong> email template and the <strong>Password Check Required Immediately</strong> email template. Both of these templates are located in <strong>System Templates</strong> under the <strong>IT</strong> category.</p>\n<p>If you only wish to monitor your user's clicks, see our <strong>Change of Password Required Immediately</strong> email template:<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/The+%22Change+of+Password+Required+Immediately%22+template.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/The+%22Change+of+Password+Required+Immediately%22+template.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>If you wish to monitor your user's clicks and see how many enter their information, see our <strong>Password Check Required Immediately</strong> email template:<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/The+%22Password+Check+Required+Immediately%22+template.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/The+%22Password+Check+Required+Immediately%22+template.png' alt=' '></a></p>",

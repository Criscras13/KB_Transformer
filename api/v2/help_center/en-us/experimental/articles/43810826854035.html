      "alt": "This image displays a User Interface (UI) modal or dedicated landing page for introducing a new AI feature suite called \"AIDA,\" focusing on automated security risk management and training. The background features a light blush color.\n\n### I. Header and Context\n\nThe screen is headed by the large, bold title, **\"Introducing AIDA.\"**\n\nThis is followed by two introductory paragraphs detailing the feature's purpose: managing human risk using AI to reduce organizational risk and improve user behavior. A key sentence notes, **\"For a limited time, you can try our first AIDA features for free.\"**\n\nA subsequent subheading, **\"Preview our first AIDA features below,\"** leads into the main content.\n\n### II. Feature Display Grid\n\nFive distinct AIDA features are presented in bordered boxes. Each feature box utilizes a consistent design: a header strip with a red-to-orange horizontal gradient containing the feature title, and a white lower section containing the text description.\n\nThe features are organized in a two-column grid, followed by one full-width entry:\n\n1.  **AIDA Template Generation:** Create custom phishing and callback phishing templates on demand.\n2.  **AIDA Automated Training:** Automatically assign personalized training based on learners\u2019 Risk Score, phishing failures, and other factors.\n3.  **AIDA Plan Quizzes:** Generate quizzes to ensure learners understand organizational plans.\n4.  **AIDA Knowledge Refreshers:** Help learners retain training via automatic creation and assignment of short quizzes.\n5.  **AIDA Orchestration (Full Width):** Automate personalized phishing tests and training using AI for continuous user risk assessment and removal of manual campaign management.\n\n### III. Footer and Action Controls\n\nThe bottom section of the screen contains opt-out information and action buttons:\n\n*   **Opt-Out Clause:** A line preceded by an information icon (\u24d8) provides details on opting out: \"You can opt out of AIDA at any time by contacting [AOsupport@knowbe4.com](mailto:AOsupport@knowbe4.com).\" (The email address is displayed as a hyperlink).\n*   **Action Buttons:** Two buttons are aligned to the bottom right:\n    *   **Cancel** (Standard, white button)\n    *   **Opt In** (Primary action button, filled red)",

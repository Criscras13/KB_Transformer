The <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> is a quick and easy way to implement risk management using your KCM GRC platform.</p>\n<p>This guide will assist you with navigating through the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong>.

This collection of risks is called the Master Risk Repository. All of the risks in the Master Risk Repository were gathered from the National Institute of Standards and Techn<span>ology (NIST) Special Publication 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.</span></p>\n<p>In addition to the NIST risks that you can choose from, you can import or create custom risks while using the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong>. All of the risks you select and/or create while using the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> will be added to your KCM GRC <strong>Risk Register</strong> upon completion.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HW8HHQE4KDY27TA8C7Q9K839'>Risk Wizard Steps</h2>\n<p>After logging in to your account, navigate to the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> by clicking on <strong>Risk Management</strong>, then <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> from your navigation panel.

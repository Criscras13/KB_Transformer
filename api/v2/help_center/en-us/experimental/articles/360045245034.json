To help you meet your compliance objectives, we offer a variety of managed templates that you can use in your platform. We are continually adding new templates to KCM GRC based on the number of requests that we receive. For a current list of all managed templates that we offer, please see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360022753993.html' target='_self'>Managed Templates</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If your organization needs to work toward a scope that we do not offer as a managed template, you can create a custom template for your platform. You can add requirements to the custom template by importing requirements in bulk, mapping existing requirements, or creating requirements one-by-one. Then, you can convert the custom template into a scope and begin working toward its scoped requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please see the sections below to learn how to create a custom template, prepare a set of requirements, and add requirements to the custom template.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> If you have already created a template and added requirements to it, refer to our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360046703714.html' target='_self'>How to Convert a Template to a Scope</a> article to learn how to convert the template to a scope.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01J82M61AV1RK14N0RQNV94QQH'>Creating a Custom Template</h2>\n<p>First, create a custom template by following the instructions below.\u00a0</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>From the navigation panel, select <strong>Compliance</strong> &gt; <strong>Templates</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Create</strong> button in the top-right area of the page.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Create Template </strong>window, add details to your template by following the instructions below.\u00a0\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>We recommend that you avoid including the &lt; and &gt; special characters in these fields.\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n<ol role='list' type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Name:</strong> Enter a name for the custom template.

Actionable requirements include an action that your organization must perform to meet an objective. Often, actionable requirements clearly state what you need to do to comply with a regulation or standard. Requirements that are not actionable do not prompt your organization to perform a specific action. Many requirements that are not actionable only involve other parts of the document, such as other requirements or chapters. By only adding actionable requirements, your organization will be able to focus on the objectives that you are working to meet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please see the table below for examples of requirements that are actionable and requirements that are not actionable.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>These examples are from our HIPAA Privacy and Breach v1.0 managed template.</div>\n</div>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=''><strong>Actionable</strong></td>\n<td class=''><strong>Not Actionable</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>164.508 (c)(4) Authorization - Copy to the Individual</strong></p>\n<p>If a covered entity seeks an authorization from an individual for a use or disclosure of protected health information, the covered entity must provide the individual with a copy of the signed authorization.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: This requirement clearly tells you what you need to do to comply with the regulation.

Then, when you add requirements to a template, the characters you entered into the <strong>Primary ID</strong> and <strong>Sub ID</strong> fields will combine to create the requirement's <strong>Requirement ID</strong>. For example, if your <strong>Primary ID</strong> is \"a\" and your <strong>Sub ID</strong> is \"1\", the <strong>Requirement ID</strong> would be \"a.1\".</p>\n<p>Requirements are ordered by their <strong>Requirement IDs</strong> in templates and in the scopes that are converted from templates.\u00a0KCM GRC uses natural sort order to sort requirements by <strong>Requirement ID</strong>. By using this method, <strong>Requirement IDs</strong> are sorted in alphabetical and numerical order, and numbers with multiple digits are considered as one number. For example, a requirement with <strong>Requirement ID</strong> \"a.3\" would appear before a requirement with <strong>Requirement ID</strong> \"a.20.\" You can select a separator, including as a comma, hyphen, period, or space, when you import or add requirements into your platform.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> You can use numbers, letters, and special characters in the\u00a0<strong>Primary ID</strong> and <strong>Sub ID</strong> fields.

  "body": "<p>The <strong>Team Dashboard</strong> is a customizable dashboard designed for managers to view in their Learner Experience (LX). The default Team Dashboard displays the manager's team, which includes their direct reports. Each manager can also view the Team Dashboard for up to three levels of managers below them in their organization's management hierarchy.</p>\n<p>On the dashboard, managers can view the training progress for the users on the selected team. They can also view the status of the users' optional learning, if Optional Learning is enabled in your organization's account. You have the option to include the team\u2019s phishing results and combined Risk Score too. All the data displayed on the Team Dashboard is from the last 12 months.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> The Team Dashboard only displays data from active campaigns.</div>\n</div>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/learner_experience/Team+Dashboard/TeamDashboard.gif'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/learner_experience/Team+Dashboard/TeamDashboard.gif' alt=' '></a></p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> If you are looking for information about your Team Dashboard, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/5600413909651'>Team Dashboard Overview for Managers</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Click the links below to learn how to set up the Team Dashboard feature.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1V9XGT4V76Z5EA2Q3DTBM7'>Before You Begin</h2>\n<p>When users are imported into the KSAT console, user-specific information is typically imported as well. This information includes a <strong>Manager</strong> field that determines which users are managers and which users report to those managers.</p>\n<p>Before enabling Team Dashboards, make sure that the users in your console have managers listed in their user information. You can verify your users\u2019 information by reviewing the <strong>Manage Users</strong> page in your admin console. To review this information, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In your KSAT console, navigate to the <strong>Users</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>In the top-right of the <strong>Manage Users</strong> page, click the gear icon.</li>\n<li>From the drop-down menu that opens, select <strong>Manager Email</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Manager Email</strong> column will now display in the user list.

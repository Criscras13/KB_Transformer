Cybercriminals use phishing attacks to gain access to your personal information. To combat this issue, it's important that your users can identify red flags and possible threats in phishing emails.</p>\n<p>Our KSAT console offers a new-school approach to training users on the threat of phishing by allowing you to create phishing campaigns that send simulated phishing emails to your users. These emails mimic actual phishing attacks to help teach your users how to stay alert and look out for red flags.</p>\n<p>To learn more about phishing campaigns, read the sections below or visit the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000156648-Phishing-Campaigns'>Phishing Security Tests</a> section of our Knowledge Base.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01EDPBFWQ26Y5J8ZKWCT7R64XE'>How It Works</h2>\n<p>After setting up your KSAT console, you can <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204239938.html'>create</a> a phishing campaign to best fit your organization's needs. You can choose how many Phishing Security Tests (PSTs) you would like to send, and you can customize your campaign using different topics and <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204240768.html'>templates</a>. You also have the option to set up <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010417528.html'>ongoing phishing tests</a>.</p>\n<p>PSTs are sent to your users once a campaign starts. If your organization uses the Phish Alert Button (PAB), your users can use this button to report the PSTs. Users who fail the PSTs can be enrolled in <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204948207.html'>training campaigns</a> to help them better identify possible phishing threats. You can also monitor your users' progress in your KSAT console.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01EDPBG3W3DXRBFTD3BQC9YSCS'>Types of Phishing Attack Vectors</h2>\n<p>You can use the phishing feature in your KSAT console to help manage the ongoing problem of phishing attacks.

They will also be prompted to enter additional personal information during the call.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USB Drive</td>\n<td>A USB drive attack allows you to test your users on how they will react to finding an unknown removable storage device, such as a thumb drive.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For more information about the types of simulated attacks that our platform offers, visit our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4406582898195.html'>Types of Simulated Phishing Tests (PSTs)</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01EDPBGAA555269JZ3TPTRF2N5'>Phish Alert Button (PAB)</h2>\n<p>Our free <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html'>Phish Alert Button (PAB)</a> tool simplifies the process of reporting phishing attacks. Once installed, the PAB will display in the toolbar of your email client and allow your users to report phishing emails to your organization. When your users report a simulated phishing email using the PAB, a small text box displays, congratulating them on reporting the phishing email.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/article_attachments/360080978054'><img src='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/article_attachments/360080978054' alt=''></a></p>\n<p>For more information about the PAB, visit the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/sections/4406704235667'>Phish Alert Button</a> articles on our Knowledge Base.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01EEKBPRRT8XN6690TGHC5S2PY'>Reports</h2>\n<p>We offer a wide range of reports that you can generate on the <strong>Reports</strong> tab of your KSAT console, including phishing reports.

This setting will help you track activity in PSTs, such as when users open emails, select links, and open attachments. If you've selected the <strong>Track Replies to Phishing Emails</strong> check box, any user who replies to the simulated phishing emails will also be tracked.

Your organization\u2019s Phish-prone Percentage is the percentage of users who are likely to fall victim to phishing attacks. Your organization's overall Phish-prone Percentage, or account average Phish-prone Percentage, is based on the Phish-prone Percentage of your active users who have received at least one PST. Each user also has an individual Phish-prone Percentage included in their user details, which lets you know how likely they are to fail a phishing test.</p>\n<p>For more information on how your organization's Phish-prone Percentage is calculated, visit our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010178267.html'>Failures and Phish-prone Percentages</a> article.</p>",

  "body": "<p>If you received an error page after following a phishing link, you may be viewing the phishing link outside of the standard KnowBe4 workflow.

Otherwise, our content will not be accessible. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/internal/Referer%20Redirect/infographic_02.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/internal/Referer%20Redirect/infographic_02.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<div class='callout-remember'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>The only way to share a phishing link within a simulated phishing email is to forward the email.</div></div>\n<p>The reason KnowBe4 content is not accessible outside of the workflow is that we use a referer redirect for all of our landing pages. A referer redirect will automatically change or redirect the link\u2019s destination depending on where the link was accessed from. This ensures that KnowBe4 content is being viewed as it was intended.</p>\n<p><a href='#h_01GQR2AS6MENJ7Y0WS5Q5S3Z06' target='_self'>Back to top</a></p>\n\n",

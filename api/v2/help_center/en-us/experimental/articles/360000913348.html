If you receive this email, it means your mail server correctly shares certificate information. If you don't receive this email, it could mean that your mail server has an incorrect TLS certificate, doesn't support TLS, or is otherwise set up incorrectly.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email w/ Soft SPF Failure</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain with a \"soft fail\" SPF record.</td>\n<td>This means the sender is not authorized to use the \"From\" email address domain that it is using. Emails such as this could be potential phishing attempts, spoofing a well-known or trusted entity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email w/ Hard SPF Failure</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain with a \"hard fail\" SPF record.</td>\n<td>This means the sender is not authorized to use the \"From\" email address domain that it is using. Emails such as this could be potential phishing attempts, spoofing a well-known or trusted entity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email w/ Punycode Domain (IDN Homograph)</td>\n<td>Imitates an IDN Homograph attack. Uses a \"From\" email address domain that appears to be another domain by using Punycode.</td>\n<td>IDN homograph attacks can deceive users into clicking on links that appear to be popular, safe websites but are actually malicious sites. A Punycode \"From\" email sender can trick users into believing the email they received is from a legitimate or trusted source.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoofed Email (From address)</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain in the \"From\" email address field that spoofs your organization's domain.</td>\n<td>Emails like this can deceive your users into believing an email they received is safe and can be trusted, as they appear to be internal communication.\u00a0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoofed Email (Reply address)</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain in the \"Reply to\" email address field that spoofs your organization's domain.</td>\n<td>Emails like this can deceive your users into believing an email they received is safe and can be trusted, as they appear to be internal communication.\u00a0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoofed Email (Altered domain)</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain in the \"From\" email address field that spoofs your organization's domain but uses a different top-level domain (TLD), such as <em><strong>.corn</strong></em> instead of <em><strong>.com</strong></em>.</td>\n<td>Emails like this can deceive your users into believing an email they received is safe and can be trusted.

What should I do?</h3>\n<p><em>Check your Spam and Junk folder. The initial email we send does not contain anything that should be flagged by normal security controls.

      "alt": "The image displays a chronological log or audit trail interface for email delivery and compliance tests, utilizing status icons, descriptive titles, and timestamps.\n\n**General UI and Structure:**\nThe interface lists four events vertically. Each entry includes a left-aligned status icon, a context icon (envelope/letter symbol), a text description, and a right-aligned status or timestamp.\n\n**Event Detail and Status Indicators:**\n\n1.  **Success/Pass (Top and Bottom):** Two entries are marked with a green checkmark icon.\n    *   Event 1: \"Email w/ Hard SPF Failure\" (Timestamp: \"10 minutes ago\").\n    *   Event 4: \"Spoofed Email (Reply address)\" (Timestamp: \"5 minutes ago\").\n\n2.  **Pending Status (Lower Middle):**\n    *   Event 3: \"Spoofed Email (From address)\" is associated with the status text \"Not Sent Yet.\"\n\n3.  **Critical Failure (Expanded Entry):** The central entry displays an expanded view detailing a critical error.\n    *   **Status Indicator:** A yellow/orange circle containing a black exclamation mark (**!**) denotes a warning or failure state.\n    *   **Title:** The title \"Email w/ Punycode Domain (IDN Homograph)\" is rendered in red text, indicating the failed test condition. (Timestamp: \"an hour ago\").\n\n**Expanded Error Panel (SMTP Response):**\nThe critical failure entry is expanded to display a detailed SMTP Response within a yellow-bordered box.\n\n*   **Header:** **SMTP Response:**\n*   **Message Content:** The response details a block action due to non-compliance with RFC 5322 specifications:\n    *   Error Code: `550 5.7.1` (repeatedly used as the error context identifier).\n    *   Specific Failure: \"Our system has detected that this message is 5.7.1 not RFC 5322 compliant: 5.7.1 'From' header has non compliant domain name.\"\n    *   Action Taken: \"this message has been 5.7.1 blocked.\"\n    *   Reference URL: A directive to visit `https://support.google.com/mail/?p=RfcMessageNonCompliant` for further information.\n    *   Internal Identifier: The message concludes with the identifier `b9si825299qka.97 - gsmtp`.\n\n**External Annotations:**\nTwo external annotations, labeled '1' and '2' and stylized as orange numbered arrows, appear adjacent to the critical and pending entries, likely indicating a flow or step sequence within a testing process: Arrow '2' points up, adjacent to the expanded entry; Arrow '1' points down, adjacent to the \"Spoofed Email (From address)\" entry.",

    "body": "\n<p>You may occasionally get reports that the Prevent <strong>shield</strong> icon has disappeared from a user's Microsoft Outlook. There are multiple potential causes for this problem. This article will walk you through the most common issues behind the missing Prevent <strong>shield</strong> icon and how to resolve them.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JQ9ZEAFPZ6QGZ75NKZF102WJ'>Simplified Ribbon</h2>\n<p>The most common cause of the Prevent <strong>shield</strong> icon disappearing is the <strong>Simplified Ribbon</strong> view, which reduces the number of icons visible on the toolbar. This issue can occur if the user has either manually selected this option or if a Microsoft Outlook update has automatically switched to this view.</p>\n<p>To restore the Prevent <strong>shield</strong> icon in this case:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a new email window in Microsoft Outlook.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the far-right side of the toolbar and select the <strong>downward arrow</strong> icon.</li>\n<li>From the drop-down menu, select <strong>Classic Ribbon</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Admin+Support/Prevent+-+classic+ribbon.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Admin+Support/Prevent+-+classic+ribbon.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p>This option will restore the ribbon to its original, more detailed view, allowing the full array of icons, including the Prevent <strong>shield</strong> icon, to be displayed.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JQ9ZEAFPFSD81W109BXNKC3W'>Multiple Outlook Add-Ins</h2>\n<p>If a user has multiple Microsoft Outlook add-ins, one of them may have taken precedence over the Prevent <strong>shield</strong> icon in the ribbon.</p>\n<p>To resolve this issue, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Microsoft Outlook, navigate to <strong>File Options Add-ins</strong>.</li>\n<li>Disable or reorder the add-ins to ensure the Prevent shield icon is given priority.</li>\n<li>Restart Microsoft Outlook to apply the changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These steps will ensure that the Prevent shield icon remains visible on the ribbon.</p>",

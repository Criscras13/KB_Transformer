For example, your user may have emails at <a href='mailto:user@domain.com'>user@domain.com</a>, <a href='mailto:user@domain.co.uk'>user@domain.co.uk</a>, or <a href='mailto:user@alternatedomain.com'>user@alternatedomain.com</a>.</p>\n<p>When you first join the KnowBe4 family, the only domain that will be active on your account is the initial domain that your organization signed up with. If your organization uses multiple domains in your email system, follow the steps in our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013430414-How-to-Add-and-Verify-Allowed-Domains'>How to Add and Verify Allowed Domains</a> article to add these additional domains to your account.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Remember:</strong>When changing user email domains within your organization, user access to the KnowBe4 platform may be affected. After the domain change, sync your User Management system, such as Active Directory, Azure AD, or SCIM, and confirm that the new email domains are added and displayed in your KnowBe4 account settings. This step prevents the loss of user data, training progress, and access to platform functions. If there are any access issues, restore your archived user accounts by unarchiving them.</div>\n</div>",

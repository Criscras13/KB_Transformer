One way you can test your users is to add attachments to your phishing tests to see whether or not your users will open them. When creating your phishing campaign, you can do this by selecting <strong>Attachments with Macros</strong> under <strong>Template Topics</strong>. For more information on creating and managing your Phishing Security Tests, visit our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204239938-Create-and-Manage-Phishing-Campaigns'>Create and Manage Phishing Campaigns</a> article.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/PhishingTemplates_AttachmentsWithMacros.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/PhishingTemplates_AttachmentsWithMacros.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p>If you don't want your users to be tested with phishing emails that include attachments, you can disable specific attack vectors by clicking the <strong>Template Exclusions</strong> link in the top-right corner of <strong>System Templates</strong> in the <strong>Phishing</strong> tab.

If a user is previewing an attachment outside of its native program, this may not be tracked as an attachment open. However, if the user clicks the link in the attachment, you may see a click failure.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01JMYR8G60MJB5Z3MWD4N7WX0Q'>How Attachment Opens and Enabled Macros Are Tracked</h2>\n<p>Attachment opens are tracked by a small tracking image placed in the attachment, except for PDF attachments. If that image is allowed to load or the user opens the file, then your console will report the attachment as being opened.</p>\n<p>In PDF attachments, opens are recorded when users click on links embedded within the PDF documents.</p>\n<p>For macro attachments, the file is beaconized and will \"call home\" to our servers when the macro is enabled, and the enabled macro will be recorded in your phishing campaign results.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JMYRDYHNK8QT37AGNC4X0Q64'>Why Attachments Might Not Show as Open</h3>\n<p>If you have conducted an attachment phishing test and you find your results to be potentially inaccurate, then the following may be occurring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your user must open the attachment in its native program for it to be tracked. If your user does not open the attachment in its native program, the opening of the attachment won\u2019t be recorded. The native programs include Adobe for PDF attachments, Excel for XLS attachments, Word for DOC attachments, and so on.</li>\n<li>If your users are only using a preview method to look at the attachment, this action may not count as an opened attachment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JMYRRZHZW7JSW3RYX5ZPWTNV'>How Phishing Attachment Failures Are Reported</h2>\n<p>Phishing attachment opens are tracked by a small tracking image placed in the attachment. If your users are opening phishing attachments, but their Attachment Opened failures aren't being tracked, a firewall or proxy may be blocking the connection to our KnowBe4 domains. You can view our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645138-Whitelisting-Guide#mailservers'>Whitelisting Guide</a> for further information on how to whitelist our domains.</p>\n<p>You can optionally test whether your web filter is blocking the Attachment Opened failures by extracting the URL in the attachment. To locate the URL, open the email that contains the attachment with the URL you want to find. Once you have located the attachment, read the sections below for instructions on how to extract the URL for that attachment type.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JMYRVYWS9BKVZK4Z9CEGVNCS'>Microsoft 365 Attachments</h3>\n<p>Microsoft 365 attachments use XML-based files.

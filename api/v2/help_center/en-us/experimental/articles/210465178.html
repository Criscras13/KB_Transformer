  "body": "<p>The Email Exposure Check Pro (EEC Pro) is a free tool that searches for publicly available information about a domain and compiles that information into a report. This tool finds information from data breaches, your users' social media accounts, online files, and more.</p>\n<p>You can use EEC Pro to become aware of vulnerabilities in your organization, such as users who have been involved in data breaches or users who have public email addresses. Cybercriminals can use publicly available information to target your users in social engineering attacks, so EEC Pro reports can help your organization prepare for these attacks.</p>\n<h2 id='iv_h_01HSE8XKS875PEY2S7GQ18V272'>What Information Does EEC Pro Search For?</h2>\n<p>EEC Pro searches through three main categories of data for public information that is related to your domain.</p>\n<p>Please see below for information about each of these categories.</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Data Breaches: EEC Pro searches through data breaches to see if your users' information has been exposed. If your users continue to use credentials that were exposed in a data breach, your organization may be vulnerable. Cybercriminals can access these credentials to target your users and your organization.</li>\n<li>Online Information: EEC Pro searches through online archives, online files, and online forums. If your users' information is accessible online, your organization may be vulnerable. Cybercriminals can use this information to identify your organizational structure. Then, they can perform targeted social engineering attacks on your organization.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note: </strong>EEC Pro searches through the following file types: .PDF, .DOC, .DOCX, .XML, .HTML, .RTF, .ODT, and .Pages.\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Social Media: EEC Pro searches through social media platforms to find accessible information about your users, such as their social media accounts. Users who have accessible social media accounts or who post detailed information on social media may be more likely to receive targeted social engineering attacks.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='iv_h_01HSE8XKS8H1GFCK1VPDN6GE52'>How to Receive Your EEC Pro Report</h2>\n<p>Please follow the steps below to run an Email Exposure Check on your domain and receive an EEC Pro report.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong> You can only request an EEC Pro report for a domain if you have access to an email address from the same domain. For example, you can request information for a website.com domain if you have access to a [username]@website.com email address.\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Navigate to the <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/email-exposure-check/' target='_self'>KnowBe4 Email Exposure Check web page</a>.</li>\n<li>Enter your information into the\u00a0<strong>Send me my Free Report</strong> form.</li>\n<li>Click the\u00a0<strong>Send me the report!</strong> button.

These groups are based on the types of data that EEC Pro finds about your users.</p>\n<p>Please see the bullet points below for details about each of groups.\u00a0</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Very High Risk: </strong>EEC Pro found these users in public data breaches that released cleartext passwords or password hashes. Cybercriminals are likely to target these users because they may be able to use their data to gain unauthorized access to your organization's network. Your users may be unaware that their passwords were included in the breach, so they may continue to use these passwords or similar passwords.\u00a0 <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FreeTools/EEC+PRO/FreeTools_EEC+Data+Breach+Info.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FreeTools/EEC+PRO/FreeTools_EEC+Data+Breach+Info.png' alt='Data Breach Info PNG'></a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>High Risk: </strong>EEC Pro found these users in public data breaches that released sensitive personal information, such as email addresses, company background, or phone numbers.

Often, a data breach </span>occurs because a cybercriminal illegally gathers private data from a system or network by exploiting a vulnerability. Data breaches can expose any sensitive or private information.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01J685KKW6DKCK7K0T6MV5WD3R'>Where does KnowBe4 find the information about data breaches?</h3>\n<p>KnowBe4 partners with Spycloud to search through data breaches and determine what user accounts have been affected. Spycloud is a reputable online resource that allows users to search for their email addresses in about 12,000 different databases to see if their information has become accessible due to data breaches.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01J685M2VQDZ82CC059WQ06JWP'>What should I do with the information in the EEC Pro report?</h3>\n<p>Accessible information that involves your organization or your users can increase your organization's vulnerability to a cyber attack.</p>\n<p>We recommend that you perform the actions below.\u00a0</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Train your users on password security, social engineering attacks, and securing personal information.\u00a0\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Anything that we include in the EEC Pro report is public information, so programs that analyze email addresses can also access this information. Therefore, all of the email addresses in your EEC Pro report are potential phishing targets. You should enroll these users in Security Awareness Training and phishing campaigns to strengthen your organization's human firewall.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Notify users who are in the\u00a0<strong>Very High Risk</strong> and <strong>High Risk</strong> categories that their information has been exposed by data breaches.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Please see question 4 below for an email template that you can use to notify these users.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Request that the users who are in the <strong>Very High Risk\u00a0</strong>category change their passwords.\u00a0\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Many users use the same password for multiple websites, so they may need to change their password for multiple accounts.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Request that the users who are in the\u00a0<strong>Very High Risk\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>High Risk\u00a0</strong>categories enable multi-factor authentication.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Multi-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security, which can help to prevent cybercriminals from accessing your users' private information.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove public information about your organization from the internet.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>If external sites are posting data about your users without your permission, we recommend that you contact the website owners. If these websites are sharing your users' email addresses, you can prepare these users for potential phishing emails.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01J685MMEZZXANY557H0G403NA'>How do I notify my users that their information was exposed in a breach?</h3>\n<p>You can use the template below to notify users that their information was exposed in a data breach. Please replace the text in brackets and customize any text to fit your organization's needs.</p>\n<p><em>Hello <strong>[name]</strong>,</em></p>\n<p><em>We have discovered that some of your information was exposed in a data breach. A data breach occurs when secure information is released to an untrusted environment. This does not necessarily mean that your data or identity was compromised, but it does mean that your information is accessible. However, there are precautions that you can take to secure your accounts.</em></p>\n<p><em>At a minimum, we strongly recommend changing your passwords for your online accounts immediately. We also recommend that you set up multi-factor authentication such as <strong>[insert recommendation]\u00a0</strong>or a password manager such as <strong>[insert recommendation]\u00a0</strong>for an extra layer of security.</em></p>\n<p><em>Please also be aware that when your information is part of a data breach, cybercriminals may use this information to target you in phishing attacks. Please stay alert, and be cautious of any emails that you receive.</em></p>\n<p><em>Sincerely, <strong>[Your Name]</strong></em></p>",

  "body": "<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>Second Chance is a tool for Outlook and Microsoft 365 that gives your users a warning message before they visit a potentially unsafe or unknown website. Users who click URLs within emails, Microsoft 365 files, or PDF files will receive an alert from Second Chance. Then, the users can select whether they would like to open the link or file.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Second Chance can be installed locally or deployed through your Group Policy (GPO). You can also mark specific URLs as safe to open so that the URLs won\u2019t trigger Second Chance alerts.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong> Second Chance is not an endpoint protection tool and doesn\u2019t block users from visiting websites. Second Chance helps with user behavior monitoring and security awareness training. If a user clicks a link in an email, a Microsoft 365 file, or a PDF file, the alert they receive will give them a second chance to rethink before they navigate to a website that may be dangerous.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='iv_01H7TRK4QRMHSV2CGH9VJG8C6T'>Installation Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before you install Second Chance, make sure you meet the requirements listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You'll need to have access to a computer that meets the requirements below:\n<ul>\n<li>Uses Windows 10 or later.</li>\n<li>Uses Microsoft Outlook 2013 or later.</li>\n<li>Uses .NET 4.5.1 or later.</li>\n<li>Port 443 TCP (HTTPS) is open outbound for HTTPS connections to training.knowbe4.com, eu.knowbe4.com, ca.knowbe4.com, de.knowbe4.com, or uk.knowbe4.com, depending on your KSAT instance.

You can modify the text in the <strong>Message Banner</strong>, <strong>Message Prompt</strong>, <strong>Continue</strong> button, and <strong>Abort</strong> button.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the screenshot and list below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/secondchance/SC_General_Lettered.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/secondchance/SC_General_Lettered.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Message Banner</strong>: This banner will display at the top of the prompt.

The character limit for this banner is 40 characters.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='iv_01H7TRK4QRSPAWZASR9520BQEH'>Punycode Prompt Text</h3>\n<p>In the <strong>Punycode Prompt</strong> section, you can modify the <strong>Punycode Description</strong>. This description indicates that Punycode was detected in the link that the user clicked. This text will only display in the Punycode prompt.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the screenshot and list below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/secondchance/SC_Punycode_Lettered.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/secondchance/SC_Punycode_Lettered.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Message Banner Text</strong>: This banner is displayed at the top of the prompt.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Message Prompt Text</strong>: This text can remind the user to consider where the link is taking them and to check for signs that it may be dangerous.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Continue Button Text</strong>: This button allows the user to move forward with their action and open the link they clicked.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Punycode Description Text</strong>: This text can be used to describe the Punycode detected in a URL.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Abort Button Text</strong>: This button allows the user to cancel their current action and avoid opening the link they clicked.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='iv_01H7TRK4QR1GEF2QE3NBVMFD8E'>What is Punycode?</h3>\n<p>By using Punycode, cybercriminals can imitate the domains of popular websites. Punycode allows characters in a URL to display like regular characters while the computer reads the characters differently. For example, the link your user is clicking may display https://knowbe4.com, but the link may lead to https://xn--80ak6aa92e.com/. For more information, see Wikipedia\u2019s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode'>Punycode</a> webpage.</p>\n<h3 id='iv_01H7TRK4QRAWAE8XQN5ZSB9ABB'>Attachment Prompt Text</h3>\n<p>In the <strong>Attachment Prompt Text</strong> section, you can modify the <strong>Attachment Description</strong>.

This description indicates that the link that the user clicked was modified from its original source. This prompt will decode or expand the URL to display the actual URL. The text for this description will only display in the URL Unwinding prompt.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the screenshot and list below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/secondchance/SC_Unwinding_Lettered.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/secondchance/SC_Unwinding_Lettered.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Message Banner Text</strong>: This banner is displayed at the top of the prompt.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Message Prompt Text</strong>: This text can remind the user to consider where the link is taking them and to check for signs that it may be dangerous.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Continue Button Text</strong>: This button allows the user to move forward with their action and open the link they clicked.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL Unwinding Description Text</strong>: This text can be used to introduce the decoded URL.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Abort Button Text</strong>: This button allows the user to cancel their current action and avoid opening the link they clicked.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can decode shortened URLs or rewritten URLs.

When you enable this setting, your users will not see a Second Chance prompt when they click a link in a KnowBe4 simulated phishing email or training notification.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If you select the <strong>Use KnowBe4's 'No Prompt Domains' List</strong> check box, your users will not receive prompts when they click links in KnowBe4's simulated phishing and training notification emails.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Use KnowBe4's \"No Prompt Domains\" List</strong>: You can use this setting to enable or disable prompts for domains listed in your <a href='#NOPROMPT'>No Prompt Domain</a> list.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>By default, if you select this check box, prompts for links in KnowBe4 simulated phishing and training notification emails will also be disabled.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='iv_01H7TRK4QR876KJQ0W7BKADH6K'>No Prompt Domains</h2>\n<p>From the <strong>No Prompt Domains</strong> section of the <strong>Settings</strong> subtab, you can specify URLs that your users won\u2019t receive Second Chance prompts for visiting. From this section, you can see a list of the No Prompt Domains you've already added. If your users visit URLs with ar No Prompt Domain, the users will not be prompted by Second Chance.</p>\n<p>No Prompt Domains can be websites that your users need to access frequently or websites that you allow your organization to use. You can add up to 1,000 domains.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>Adding a website to the <strong>No Prompt Domains</strong> list will also block prompts for all subdomains under the website\u2019s domain. For example, if you added the website <strong>knowbe4.com</strong> to the list, the subdomain <strong>training.knowbe4.com </strong>would be blocked automatically. If a URL containing a subdomain is added to the list, only URLs that contain both the subdomain and the primary domain will not receive prompts. For example, if you added <strong>training.knowbe4.com</strong> to the list, only URLs that contain <strong>training.knowbe4.com</strong> will be blocked.</div>\n</div>\n<p>By clicking the blue <strong>Import</strong> link, you can open up a modal that allows you to enter domains in two different ways.

Domains must be entered in the proper domain format. For example, you could enter \u201cknowbe4.com\u201d.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CSV Import</strong>: You can use this method to import multiple domains by uploading a CSV file. The CSV file you upload must have a <strong>Domain</strong> heading. In the <strong>Domain</strong> column, you should add one domain to each cell, line by line.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>Domains in this CSV file must be entered in the proper domain format. If you select the <strong>Replace all</strong> check box, the domains in your new CSV file will replace all of your current No Prompt Domains.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='iv_01H7TRK4QRQNQBK7PRBVEX2DM0'>Installation Methods</h2>\n<p>You can install Second Chance from your KSAT <strong>Account Settings</strong>, by using a command line, or by using your Group Policy.

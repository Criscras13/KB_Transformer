This option removes all phishing campaign information from affected accounts and from phishing reports. Smart Groups that reference Phishing Security Test failures will be impacted. The details for hidden reports can still be viewed under the <strong>Hidden</strong> section in the <strong>Campaigns</strong> subtab.</li>\n</ol>",

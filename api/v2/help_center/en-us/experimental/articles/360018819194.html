  "body": "<p>The Phish-failure Percentage is the percentage of users who failed a phishing test. Unlike the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010178267' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Phish-prone Percentage</a>, the Phish-failure Percentage does not keep track of how many ways a user failed, only that they did fail.</p>\n<p>The user \"fails\" the phishing test if they perform at least one of the following actions:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Clicking the embedded link in either the email body or within an email attachment</li>\n<li>Entering data on a landing page</li>\n<li>Opening an attachment\u00a0</li>\n<li>Enabling a macro on an attachment</li>\n<li>Replying to the simulated phishing email</li>\n<li>Calling the number and entering the callback code in a callback phishing email</li>\n<li>Entering personal information in a callback phishing call</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This percentage is then calculated by dividing the number of times the user failed a phishing test by the number of phishing tests they've received. As an example, if the user \"fails\" one test out of five, their Phish-failure Percentage will be 20%.</p>\n<p>A higher Personal Phish-failure Percentage indicates the individual user is more likely to fall for an email-born social engineering attack.</p>\n\n<h2 id='iv_01H8F8B57X8AF034XE9P258BWH'>Campaign Phish-failure Percentage</h2>\n<p>A phishing campaign's Phish-failure Percentage is calculated based on the number of users who failed a phishing test divided by the total number of users who received a phishing test in that campaign.</p>\n<p>For example, if 100 people received emails, and 52 of them clicked a link in the email and eight of those users also entered data into the landing page, the Phish-failure Percentage for that campaign would be 52%.</p>\n",

  "body": "<p>You can integrate the Phish Alert Button (PAB) with Microsoft Defender for Office to send emails to Microsoft\u2019s <strong>Submissions</strong> page for analysis. In the Microsoft 365 Defender platform, the <strong>Submissions</strong> page receives emails that users report with Microsoft\u2019s <strong>Report</strong> button. With this integration, you can allow your users to report suspicious emails to your organization and your <strong>Submissions</strong> page with the PAB. When users report KnowBe4\u2019s simulated phishing emails with the <strong>Report</strong> button, Microsoft can mistakenly classify these emails as threats. This integration also helps Microsoft recognize KnowBe4\u2019s simulated phishing emails and avoid false positives for users\u2019 reported emails.</p>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8550AWAFMAZAJVVWZK564DH'>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before you configure this integration, you'll need to enable and configure the PAB in your KSAT <strong>Account Settings</strong>.

Please see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8354913796115.html'>Smart Groups Overview</a> article for more information.</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you\u2019re a Platinum or Diamond-level customer, you can use our Smart Groups feature to automate workflows, such as remedial training enrollments, in your KnowBe4 account.</p>\n<p>This article offers a general approach to automating remedial training for users who fail your phishing security tests. If you would like to automate your simulated phishing tests <em>and</em> remedial training enrollments, we suggest following the plan outlined in this article instead: <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8355418347667.html'>Smart Groups Phishing Automation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>For general and additional information about Smart Groups, please see the <a href='#ADDITIONAL'>Additional Smart Group Resources</a> section.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HKDSSH5E5M9GS442EKT7NTB0'>Before You Begin</h2>\n<p>To build this automated remedial training plan, you'll create several Smart Groups and training campaigns. The progression of this plan depends on two user events:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>The user has completed their previous remedial training assignment</li>\n<li>The user failed a phishing test after completing their previous remedial training assignment(s)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before you can create the necessary Smart Groups, you must decide what training content you'd like to assign for each round of remedial training. From your account, browse the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115001221467.html'>ModStore</a>, or refer to your <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010358067.html'>Automated Security Awareness Program (ASAP)</a> to decide which training assignments you'd like to assign.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong> If <strong>Optional Learning</strong> is enabled for your account, remedial Smart Groups may be impacted. If a user completes the training content selected a Smart Group's criteria, they will not be added to the Smart Group. This scenario is unlikely but possible.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HKDSSH5EVKQTCCZDNCRGTSPH'>Step One: Create a Smart Group for Each Round of Remedial Training</h2>\n<p>Begin by creating a Smart Group for each round of remedial training you'd like users to be enrolled in when they fail additional phishing tests. Follow this section to add the appropriate criteria rules to each of your remedial training Smart Groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Remedial Training - Round 1</strong></p>\n<p>Name the first remedial training Smart Group something descriptive of its purpose, such as \u201cRemedial Training - Round 1\u201d.</p>\n<p>Add the following criteria for this Smart Group:</p>\n<table style='table-layout: auto;'>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='row'>Phish Event</th>\n<td>User <strong>must</strong> have had <strong>any failures more than 0</strong> time <strong>on or after XX/XX/XXXX</strong>*</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope='row'>Training</th>\n<td>User <strong>has not completed [insert \"round 1\" remedial training assignment(s) here] ever</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>*If your organization is new to the KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training platform</strong>, insert the end date of your <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010347968.html'>baseline phishing campaign</a>, here. <strong>If your organization currently has phishing tests in place</strong>, insert the date in which you plan to launch this remedial training plan, here.</p>\n<p>This set of criteria creates parameters for all users who have failed a phishing security test after the baseline (or other) phishing test, and have never completed the specified training assignment.</p>\n<p>As one of our best practices for implementing the KnowBe4 platform, we suggest conducting a blind baseline phishing test to determine your organization's Phish-prone percentage. In the <strong>Phish Event</strong> criteria rule, by specifying any failures <em>after</em> the baseline test, you're omitting failures that may have taken place before users had taken any\u00a0security awareness training. See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/225574347.html'>Best Practices Guide</a> to learn more about integrating KnowBe4 into your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Remedial Training - Round 2</strong></p>\n<p>Now, set up the second Smart Group for the users who have had an additional failure on a phishing security test <em>after</em> completing the first round of remedial training.</p>\n<p>Give the second remedial training Smart Group a descriptive name, such as \u201cRemedial Training - Round 2.\u201d</p>\n<p>Add the following criteria for this Smart Group:</p>\n<table style='table-layout: auto;'>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='row'>After Training</th>\n<td>User <strong>must</strong> have had <strong>any failures</strong> after completing: <strong>[insert \"round 1\" training assignment(s) here]</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope='row'>Training:</th>\n<td>User <strong>has not completed [insert \"round 2\" training assignment(s) here] ever**</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>**</strong>Or, use \"on or after XX/XX/XXXX\" (the date you entered for the \"Remedial Training - Round 1\" Smart Group, as explained <a href='#h_01HKDSSH5EVKQTCCZDNCRGTSPH'>above</a>).</p>\n<p>This criteria set creates parameters for users who failed a phishing test again, after taking the first round of remedial training.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Training</strong> criteria rule takes into consideration that users have not completed the assignment(s) included in the second round of remedial training. It is important to include the <strong>Training</strong> rule because this parameter will automatically remove users from this Smart Group once they complete their second round of remedial training.</p>\n<p><strong>Remedial Training - Round 3, 4, etc.</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow can be continued to create as many remedial training Smart Groups as you feel necessary.</p>\n<p>When deciding how many additional groups you should create, consider the following:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>How frequently you're phishing your users</li>\n<li>How often you'd like to re-evaluate the content you're assigning, to replace it with new content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Refer to the table below to create additional remedial training Smart Groups.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVRR1QV0JMDDAJ8TWGKXTMT2'>Smart Group Remedial Training</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Remedial Training Campaign Title</th>\n<th scope='col'>Smart Group Title</th>\n<th scope='col'>Smart Group Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 1</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 1</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Phish Event:</strong> User must have had any failures more than 0 time on or after XX/XX/XXXX*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-neutral-5);'>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 1\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 2</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 2</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);'>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing: [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 1\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 2\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 3</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 3</td>\n<td>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 2\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-neutral-5);'>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 3\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 4</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 4</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);'>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 3\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 4\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 5</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 5</td>\n<td>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 4\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-neutral-5);'>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 5\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 6</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 6</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);'>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 5\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 6\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>*If your organization is new to the KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training platform,</strong> insert the end date of your <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010347968.html'>baseline phishing campaign</a>, here. <strong>If your organization currently has phishing tests in place, </strong>insert the date in which you plan to launch this remedial training plan, here.** Or, use \"on or after XX/XX/XXXX\" (the date you entered for the \"Remedial Training -

We would also recommend adding one to two reminder notifications to encourage the user to complete the training prior to their due date.For your <strong>Welcome</strong> notification, we recommend using a template indicating that the user failed a phishing test. This lets them know why they've been enrolled in this training campaign. We have a sample template in the system (\"Oops, you failed a phishing test\") that you can make edits to by clicking the <strong>Manage Notification Email Templates</strong> link.

      "alt": "This image displays a User Interface (UI) element, specifically a button or icon representing a feature related to package tracking or management.\n\n**Visual Description:**\nThe element features a central icon placed above a two-line text label, set against a light, neutral background.\n\n**Icon Details:**\nThe icon is composed of two primary shapes:\n1. A stylized, two-dimensional drawing of a **cardboard shipping box** (package), rendered in dark gray. The box shows outlines suggesting flaps and a white horizontal sealing stripe across the top.\n2. An overlaying **magnifying glass** icon, positioned slightly to the lower right of the package. The rim and handle of the magnifying glass are colored bright blue, while the lens area is transparent white, suggesting a search or tracking function.\n\n**Text Details:**\nThe text label is centered below the icon, presented in a dark gray sans-serif font:\n* **Line 1:** \"Sent\" (Capitalized 'S', smaller font size/weight)\n* **Line 2:** \"Packages\" (Capitalized 'P', larger font size/weight than the first line)\n\n**Contextual Function:**\nThis UI element functions as an actionable link or button titled \"Sent Packages,\" visually reinforced by the icon combining a package and a search/magnifying symbol, indicating a feature for viewing or tracking outbound/sent shipments.",

  "body": "<p>AIDA Orchestration is an always-on, AI-driven system that automatically manages and personalizes your Phishing Security Tests (PSTs) and security awareness training (SAT) to reduce user risk. AIDA uses AI to generate phishing templates and automatically sends phishing tests to users.</p>\n<p>Even with this system enabled, you will retain full control to fine-tune the system's behavior and monitor all activity.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01K5CB3JNTJYDZJJX8C2TH4W0Y'>Enabling AIDA Orchestration</h2>\n<p>To enable AIDA Orchestration, log in to your KnowBe4 console and click the<strong> Orchestration tab. </strong></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aida/Orchestration/1_ao_enable_main.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aida/Orchestration/1_ao_enable_main.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>Click the <strong>Enable Orchestration</strong> button. A confirmation window will pop up asking if you want to enable AIDA Orchestration. To continue, click the <strong>Continue</strong> button, and the <strong>General</strong> section of the AIDA Orchestration enablement page opens. If you don\u2019t want to continue, click the <strong>Cancel</strong> button.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5CB4J5EBWQKPR1C1N52PVNE'>General Settings</h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s get AIDA Orchestration working for you by creating a default plan that tells AIDA how to manage and personalize your team's phishing security tests and training.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K7FE82ZRS9WYJ5R15TV3SWDJ'>What is a Plan?</h3>\n<p>A plan tells AIDA how to manage security awareness training for specific groups of users. Think of it as your blueprint for automation: you define who gets included, how often they receive phishing tests and training, then AIDA Orchestration handles the day-to-day execution.</p>\n<p>Each Plan includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>User groups</strong> you want to include and any you want to exclude</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Phishing</strong> <strong>or Training frequency</strong> limits for phishing tests and security awareness training</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01K7FE8EZZ2BV2CER6MXDVECSV'>Why use multiple Plans?</h3>\n<p>Different teams often need different approaches to security training. Plans let you customize AIDA Orchestration\u2019s automation for each group's needs.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K7FE8KJ14V5CG92GMQQEG0SG'>How Plans work together:</h3>\n<p>When you have multiple plans, they follow a priority order you set. If a user appears in multiple groups across different plans, AIDA Orchestration applies the plan with the highest precedence to that user. This feature prevents conflicts and ensures consistent training delivery.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the options in this section, see the screenshot and the list below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aida/Orchestration/aida_orchestration_enable_general3.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aida/Orchestration/aida_orchestration_enable_general3.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Plan Enabled</strong>: This toggle is already enabled.<br>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note: </strong>This toggle does not immediately enable AIDA Orchestration.

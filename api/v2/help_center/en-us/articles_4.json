Full details on this Deployment Manager can be found within the following subsections, but it will require a Global Administrator from your tenant to authorize the implementation via Device Code authentication.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JQ71G20EF09S0MACC9NSVDYS'>Authentication Requirements</h3>\n<p>Deployment Manager is a Windows application that is run by a KnowBe4 Engineer to enable remote and easy installation of Prevent for mobile. Using Microsoft OAuth Device authentication, the Deployment Manager authenticates with a client\u2019s Microsoft 365 environment remotely. The Deployment Manager must be run on a KnowBe4 employee\u2019s computer, connected to a KnowBe4 VPN, without the client needing to physically enter their username and password onto the KnowBe4 engineer\u2019s device. It will require authorization from a Global Administrator within your tenant. A \u201ctoken\u201d is received from Microsoft Graph after login, which lasts between 60 and 90 minutes, and is discarded as soon as the page containing the auth flow is closed.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JQ71G20ENSD4VD7PTMRZNA08'>Conditional Access</h3>\n<p>The Prevent Deployment Manager will be run from the KnowBe4 engineer\u2019s machine connected to a VPN from the UK or America. If you have Conditional Access policies applied to the Global Administrator who authorizes the scripts, you may need to make an exception to the Conditional Access Policy during the installation. The exception can be removed afterward.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JQ71G20E4E7F60H1YJQHC2WY'>General Flow</h3>\n<p>Emails sent from outside of the Prevent Microsoft Outlook Add-in are sent to a moderation mailbox in the Prevent Gateway and are scanned for any risks and processed accordingly. If a risk is detected, such as a misdirected email, the sender will receive a bounce-back verification email with the option to either approve and send or reject and discard the email. The flow of this feature is shown in the screenshot and list below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000004JaDZ.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000004JaDZ.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>A mobile user sends an email.</li>\n<li>The email is redirected to the Prevent Gateway via SMTP for analysis.</li>\n<li>Prevent Gateway analyses the email for any risks. If no risks are detected, the email is automatically approved and released.</li>\n<li>If a risk is detected, the Prevent Gateway will send a verification email to the sender on behalf of the shared mailbox. The sender can review the verification email and either approve or reject the send of the email. Approved messages are returned to the Prevent Gateway queue for additional SMTP processing, with encryption or decryption if required, and then returned to Microsoft 365 for final delivery. Rejected messages are deleted with a notification message to the sender or released with a MIME header that Microsoft 365 rules can act upon if needed).</li>\n<li>Approved messages are returned to Microsoft 365 for delivery to the recipient.</li>\n<li>If a user takes no action, by default, emails are auto-approved after two hours.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01JQ71G20E4P3J0SS3QR1YM78D'>Gateway Configuration</h2>\n<p>The Prevent Deployment Manager is used to configure the components required for the Prevent Gateway, reducing the risk of human error and the time required for the implementation. Below are the components implemented by the Deployment Manager:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accepted Domain\n<ul>\n<li>Configuring an accepted domain allows us to route emails to the Prevent Gateway for processing. We do not configure an MX record, but we do use the MX record value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Connectors\n<ul>\n<li>Allows emails to be transmitted between Microsoft 365 and Prevent over TLS 1.2, using the MS recommendation of CA-issued certificate-based authentication.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Microsoft 365 Group\n<ul>\n<li>The transport rules created, as shown below, are scoped to apply to a Microsoft 365 group. Prevent users will need to be manually added to the group.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Shared Mailbox\n<ul>\n<li>When a risk is detected, the Prevent Gateway will send a verification email to the sender to approve or reject whether or not the mail will be sent. This verification email is sent on behalf of the shared mailbox.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Transport Rules\n<ul>\n<li>There are two rules required. The first rule will determine what emails will be redirected to the Prevent Gateway. The second rule will determine if any emails are being sent to the shared mailbox, typically approve or reject responses, and redirect them to the Prevent Gateway.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If deployment using the deployment manager is not possible, the manual steps detailed in this section should be followed.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JQ71G20EB6DV9C2QVMDRV1QJ'>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>The prerequisites needed for configuring the gateway are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graph API ingestion configured</li>\n<li>Microsoft 365</li>\n<li>Microsoft 365 Global Administrator access</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01JQ71G20ERN758KYKM6MCBE44'>Accepted Domain</h3>\n<p>To configure an accepted domain, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the Microsoft 365 admin portal, navigate to <strong>Setup</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Get your custom domain set up</strong>, select <strong>View Manage Add domain</strong>.</li>\n<li>Configure the new domain using your Prevent Gateway domain address, which will be provided by your KnowBe4 Engineer.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01JQ71G20EXQJECGZ9M6FXWZWQ'>Connectors</h3>\n<h4 id='h_01JQ71G20EC5E96V4ESVK2G5QW'>Send Connector</h4>\n<p>To configure a send connector, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the M365 admin portal, navigate to <strong>Mail Flow Connectors</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>+ Add a Connector</strong>.</li>\n<li>Set the mail flow scenario to be from<strong> Microsoft 365</strong> to <strong>Partner Organization</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter a name for the connector.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the option to only use the connector where there is a transport rule associated with it.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Route email through these smart hosts</strong>.</li>\n<li>Add the Prevent hostname, which will be provided by your KnowBe4 Engineer.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Always use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure the connection</strong>.</li>\n<li>Tick <strong>Add the subject name</strong> and enter your Prevent hostname.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id='h_01JQ71G20EN00JD4ZS7NXGFXYS'>Receive Connector</h4>\n<p>To configure a receive connector, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the Microsoft 365 admin portal, navigate to <strong>Mail Flow Connectors</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>+ Add a connector</strong>.</li>\n<li>Set the mail flow scenario to be from <strong>Your Organization</strong> to <strong>Microsoft 365</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter a name for the connector.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter the Prevent Gateway hostname to allow Microsoft 365 to identify the source of incoming mail.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01JQ71G20E6QP00DG6E6XNR0A5'>Microsoft 365 Group</h3>\n<p>To configure a Microsoft 365 group, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the Microsoft 365 admin portal, navigate to <strong>Active Teams and Groups</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select Add a <strong>Microsoft 365 group</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter a name for the group, such as \"Prevent Moderation\".</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Assign an owner of the group.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Add relevant members to the group.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter a group email address, such as \"Prevent_Users@customer.com\".</li>\n<li>Use the <strong>Privacy</strong> drop-down menu to select <strong>Private</strong>.</li>\n<li>Untick <strong>Create a team for this group</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Review and create the group.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once created, add the desired Prevent users to the group.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JQ71G20EYKNV6BQ1ZPP1WP5H'>Shared Mailbox</h3>\n<p>Create the shared mailbox in the Microsoft 365 admin portal by following the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Teams &amp; Groups Shared mailboxes</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>+ Add a shared mailbox</strong>.</li>\n<li>The address of the mailbox should be <strong>Egress_Moderator@customer.com</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Prevent will send verification emails on behalf of this shared mailbox.

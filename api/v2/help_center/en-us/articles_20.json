We can also create our own custom templates to fit our needs.</em></p>\n<p><em>Our goal is to keep track of updates to regulations that affect our company's compliance and to be better prepared for audits. With this new software, we can give auditors access to predefined scopes that contain related compliance requirements, controls, and evidence.

The purpose of this test was to determine how our organization would react if a real phishing attack were to occur. The percentage of users who clicked the link in this simulated attack was <strong>[XX]</strong> percent.</p>\n<p>Phishing is a type of cybercrime where hackers try to gain access to your personal information such as usernames and passwords. To help combat the rise in cybercrime like phishing attacks, we decided to partner with KnowBe4. All employees will be enrolled in KnowBe4\u2019s security awareness training.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will receive an email inviting you to take KnowBe4\u2019s security awareness training. We will also continue to send out simulated phishing tests so you can practice the skills that you will learn during your training. Be on the lookout for these emails in your inbox.</p>\n<p>We depend on you as the last line of defense against cybercrime.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>John Doe</p>\n<p>Organization Name</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more information on our best practices for security awareness training, please see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/225574347.html' target='_self'>Best Practices Guide</a>.</p>",

To prepare for your webinar or walkthrough, we recommend that you complete the following steps:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Whitelist our mail servers.</li>\n<li>Prepare your list of users for import, or integrate with your Active Directory.</li>\n<li>Read our Quickstart Implementation Guide.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information about each of these steps, read the sections below.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2JGA9GWB8VYRYE0VZ9211A'>Whitelist Our Mail Servers</h2>\n<p>It is very important that you whitelist our mail servers before you send out any simulated phishing emails. If you don't whitelist our mail servers, emails may get blocked entirely or end up in your users' Junk or Spam folders.</p>\n<p>To see the IP addresses and hostnames of our servers that will need to be used in your system to whitelist us, see our<a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/203645138.html' target='_self'> Whitelisting Data and Anti-Spam Filtering Information</a> article. As a general rule, we recommend whitelisting by IP address only, which is usually the most effective method. However, this method may not be compatible with your system setup. So, feel free to whitelist as needed based on the mail server and spam filter you have in place.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note: </strong>We recommend that you set up a test campaign prior to the webinar or walkthrough to ensure that your whitelisting was done properly. Limit the test to a small test group of only one or two admins who can confirm receipt and tracking of clicks on phishing links. This campaign can be deleted once the test successfully reaches your inbox.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2JGA9GS6XF3VE7E818WKAY'>Prepare Your List of Users for Import, or Integrate with Your Active Directory</h2>\n<p>Importing your users will allow you to include them in your phishing or other social engineering campaigns, allow them to take their security awareness training, and more. There are a few methods you can use to import your users.</p>\n<p>The simplest and most efficient method for maintaining your list of users is to sync your KSAT console with your Active Directory. To learn how to do so, check out our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228373888.html' target='_self'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide</a> or our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/229045167.html' target='_self'>Configuring Active Directory Integration (ADI)</a> video.</p>\n<p>If you'd rather do a one-time import of users, you will need to prepare your list of current users. Typically, an admin will pull their list of active users from their Active Directory. For more information on how to do this, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/200281719.html' target='_self'>How Can I Import Users from Active Directory Using Disquery?</a> article.</p>\n<p>You can also download one of our sample CSV files from the KSAT console to get started. The sample CSV files contain various fields for additional user information that can be helpful to add. To download a sample CSV file, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT console, then navigate to <strong>Users</strong> &gt; <strong>Import Users</strong> &gt;<strong> CSV Import</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click one of the links with a CSV file example on the right side of the page.\n<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/before_your_walkthrough/CSV1.png'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/before_your_walkthrough/CSV1.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>After you click an example CSV file, click the <strong>Download Example CSV </strong>button if the example file meets your organization\u2019s needs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/before_your_walkthrough/CSV2.png'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/before_your_walkthrough/CSV2.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note: </strong>Not all of the fields that you see in the sample CSV file are necessary. The only required field is the <strong>Email</strong> field. However, we recommended that you add a <strong>First Name</strong> field and <strong>Last Name</strong> field, as well as a <strong>Group</strong> field for that user. Once groups are set up, you can use those groups to target subsets of users with phishing or training campaigns.</div>\n</div>\n<p>For more tips to prepare your CSV file, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204873347.html' target='_self'>How to Import Users with a CSV File</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2JGA9GM9CJ1KT619W4J8H0'>Read Our Quickstart Implementation Guide</h2>\n<p>As an optional third step, we recommend that you read our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/206523288.html' target='_self'>Quickstart Implementation Guide</a>.

You will need to update your XML manifest to implement the improved fallback mechanism.</div>\n</div>\n<p>The Microsoft Ribbon Phish Alert Button (PAB) allows your users to easily report suspicious emails and help protect your organization from cyberattacks. When you integrate the PAB with Microsoft's <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/spam-reporting' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>integrated spam-reporting feature</a>, the PAB will appear in the Outlook ribbon. When your users click the PAB to report an email, they can provide your IT team with an early warning about potential threats. You can receive reported emails in the Microsoft 365 Defender platform and the KSAT console. To learn how to install the Microsoft Ribbon PAB and how your users can use the PAB in their mail clients, see the sections below.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>If you use the phishing feature in the KSAT console, the Microsoft Ribbon PAB will also track if your users report our simulated phishing emails.

For information on how the [[domain]] placeholder works by default, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000536328.html' target='_self'>How the [[domain]] Placeholder Works</a> article.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> If you use a look-alike domain or a domain that is similar to your organization\u2019s real domain, we recommend that you purchase the look-alike domain. If someone else purchases the look-alike domain and your users reply to an email sent by the domain, your users may reply to the owner of the domain. Please be aware that using a real domain with anti-spoofing protection could affect email deliverability.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Disable Template Attack Vectors:</strong> Select this check box to disable phishing email templates that use specific attachment attack vectors.

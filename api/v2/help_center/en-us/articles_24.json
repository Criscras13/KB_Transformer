You can add links using the WYSIWYG editor or by editing the source code of the notification directly.</p>\n<p>To get started with either of these methods, navigate to <strong>Training</strong> &gt; <strong>Notification Templates</strong>, then open the training notification template that you would like to modify. You can also create a new template by clicking the <strong>New Training Notification Template</strong> button.</p>\n<p>Then, if you would like to add the link using the WYSIWYG editor, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the <strong>Link</strong> icon in the WYSIWYG editor toolbar.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Link</strong> pop-up window, select the <strong>Link Info</strong> tab and fill in the following fields to create your link:\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Display Text:</strong> In this field, enter the text that you would like to display in place of the URL.\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using a <strong>URL</strong> link type and you leave this field blank, the URL you renter in the <strong>URL</strong> field will automatically display in place of the display text.</li>\n<li>If you are using the <strong>Link to anchor in the text</strong> option under <strong>Link Type</strong> and leave this field blank, the name of the anchor will display in place of the display text. This <strong>Link Type</strong> is not typically used in training notifications.</li>\n<li>If you are using an <strong>E-mail</strong> link type and leave this field blank, the display text will automatically populate as the e-mail address entered in the <strong>E-mail Address</strong> field.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Link Type:</strong> This is the type of content your link navigates to. There are three options to choose from:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>URL</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Link to anchor in the text</strong></li>\n<li><strong>E-mail</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protocol:</strong> This field will be visible if a URL link type is selected. The protocol indicates how your request is transmitted or transferred. There are five options to choose from:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>http://</strong></li>\n<li><strong>https://</strong></li>\n<li><strong>ftp://</strong></li>\n<li><strong>news://</strong></li>\n<li><strong>&lt;other&gt;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL:</strong> This field will be visible if a <strong>URL</strong> link type is selected.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Once you have filled out all of the fields, click <strong>OK</strong>. Your link will be visible in the body of the training notification template.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The second way to add links is through the source code. The source code is where you can customize templates using HTML. To add a link in the source code, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the <strong>Source</strong> icon in the top-left corner of the <strong>WYSIWYG</strong> editor toolbar.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/TrainingNotifications/linkinfo.gif'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/TrainingNotifications/linkinfo.gif' alt=' '></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Add the link to the source code by using the &lt;a&gt; tag. For an example and brief description of a link in source code, see below:\n<p><code>&lt;a href=' '&gt;This is my link!&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> The opening &lt;a&gt; tag indicates the start of a link.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>&lt;/a&gt;</strong> The closing &lt;/a&gt; tag indicates the end of a link.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>href=' '</strong> The hypertext reference (href) indicates the link\u2019s destination. You want to place the web address, or URL, of your link inside the quotation marks. For example, &lt;a href=\u201dyourorganizationswebsite.com\u201d&gt;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>This is my link! </strong>The display text goes between the open and closed &lt;a&gt; tags. It can be a URL or descriptive text.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To learn more about creating links in HTML, see w3 school\u2019s <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>HTML a Tag</a> page.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01G3VD6DT30397956063S5WAJG'>Wrapping Training Notification Placeholders in Links for New or Existing Training Notifications</h2>\n<p>In your training notifications, you may want to wrap the <strong>Login</strong> or <strong>Passwordless Login</strong> placeholders in a link.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to wrap placeholders in your notifications. Linking a training notification placeholder can be done from the <strong>Link</strong> pop-up window or by adding a placeholder to the <strong>Training Notification Template</strong> with the <strong>Source</strong> option.</p>\n<p>To link a training notification placeholder using the <strong>Link</strong> pop-up window, we recommend that you use the settings below:</p>\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Display Text:</strong> [[PASSWORD-LESS_LOGIN_LINK]]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Link Type:</strong> URL</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protocol:</strong> &lt;other&gt;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL:</strong> [[PASSWORD-LESS_LOGIN_LINK]]</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> When using the <strong>Link</strong> pop-up window to link a training notification placeholder, only select <strong>&lt;other&gt;</strong> for the <strong>Protocol</strong>. If you do not choose <strong>&lt;other&gt;</strong>, the link will break due to multiple protocols in the URL. This happens because our placeholder (Example: [[LOGIN_LINK]]) already contains a built-in protocol (Example: https://training.knowbe4.com/, where <strong>https://</strong> is the protocol).</div>\n</div>\n<p>To link a training notification placeholder from within the source code, you'll need to wrap the placeholder in HTML. To do wrap the placeholder in html, apply the HTML <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> tag. For the <strong>\u201chref\u201d</strong>, enter the placeholder between the quotation marks. See the example below:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;a href=\u201c[[LOGIN_LINK]]?email=[[EMAIL]]\"&gt;Click here to log in for\n    training!&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>\n<p>In the example above, the <strong>[[LOGIN_LINK]]</strong> placeholder will navigate the user to the KnowBe4 training login page. Adding our <strong>[[EMAIL]]</strong> placeholder will make the link unique to the user, as it will populate their email address in the <strong>Email</strong> field on the login page.</p>",

What is the advantage of integrating Active Directory with my KSAT account?</h3>\n<p>You can use ADI to manage your user list in KSAT through Active Directory. The changes that you make to your AD account will affect your KSAT account at each sync. For example, if you archive a user in your AD account, the ADI sync will archive that user in your KSAT account.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can specify which user information is automatically synced into your KSAT account. Then, you can use some of this information in user placeholders when you create phishing campaigns. For more information about user placeholders, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/6548790426771.html'>User Information Placeholders Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM277B9GA7Y19J24FDGZPKG'>2.

How do I change the initial login credentials that were used to set up ADI for my organization?</h3>\n<p>To change your ADI login credentials, follow the instructions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From your computer, navigate to the <strong>Config</strong> folder: <strong>C:\\ProgramData\\KnowBe4\\ADI Sync\\Config</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Delete the <strong>.dat</strong> file from the folder.</li>\n<li>Open an elevated command prompt window.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>C:\\Program Files\\KnowBe4\\ADI Sync</strong> folder in the command prompt.</li>\n<li>Enter \"adisync.exe config\" into the command prompt.</li>\n<li>Enter your new credentials during the configuration.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM27Y3KXRJSJQ7YMEQ9RCYK'>4. Will my existing phishing and training campaigns be impacted when I turn on ADI?</h3>\n<p>When you turn on ADI, your phishing campaigns will not be impacted. Training campaigns may be impacted, depending on the campaign settings. If the training campaign has the <strong>Enable automatic enrollment for new users </strong>option selected, then users who are added to your KSAT account will be enrolled in that training campaign. To learn how to enable this option, read our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204948207.html'>Training Campaigns Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM28RJ1W5H32STS3W4H5GFQ'>5. If I make changes to my KSAT account, will any changes happen in my Active Directory?</h3>\n<p>No. While the changes you make in Active Directory will affect your KSAT account, the changes you make in your KSAT account will <em>not</em> affect Active Directory.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM28Z3EBXXHNR17KAQVS196'>6. If I have multiple domains in my AD account and I'm importing users into my KSAT account with ADI, how does ADI determine which email address to use for my users' primary email address?</h3>\n<p>If your users have multiple email addresses in Active Directory, ADI will use the <strong>reply-to</strong> email address as your users' primary email address.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM295PRNRGBZRCJKG0F5C7K'>7. What is KnowBe4's encryption method for data that is transferred between the ADI tool and KnowBe4 servers, and how does this encryption method protect my user data?</h3>\n<p>We use HTTPS/SSL to encrypt the data that is transferred between ADI and KnowBe4 servers. Unless you enable SSL when you set up ADI, ADI uses LDAP/LDAPS to communicate between your domain controller and ADI. To enable SSL, you must already have LDAPS enabled.</p>\n<p>To learn how to enable LDAPS, see <a href='#h_01HVM29Q85N3K48R2N4HF7ANDG'>question 2</a> in the <a href='#h_01HFFDRG4GHY5MTV346PRNHAB3'>Getting Started</a> section below.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HFFDRG4GHY5MTV346PRNHAB3'>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>For information to help you get started with ADI, see the questions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href='#h_01HVM29FZK9FQ619M327GZD2S4'>Can I disable user provisioning for specific users?</a></li>\n<li><a href='#h_01HVM29Q85N3K48R2N4HF7ANDG'>How do I enable LDAPS before syncing my Active Directory to KnowBe4? </a></li>\n<li><a href='#h_01HVM29XP1544MMC23894CSD11'>How can I add comments to my &lt;domain&gt;.conf file?</a></li>\n<li><a href='#h_01HVM2A9R67RQ6XDH8HDJDGTDG'>How do I manage my ADI if I have multiple source domains, but I want to sync everything to a single KSAT account?

How can I set up ADI for my clients?</h3>\n<p>You will need to install ADI for each KSAT account on a separate machine for each domain that you want to sync with. This will ensure a successful installation.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2AKW00FFTN2QZ3WVY36JX'>6. My AD users and groups are not organized how I'd like them to be organized in my KSAT account. What should I do?</h3>\n<p>In Active Directory, you can create a new organizational unit, or OU, and add groups that are named after your KSAT groups to the OU. For example, if you have a KSAT group that is named <strong>Group 1</strong>, you could create an AD group that is named <strong>KB4-Group 1</strong>. Then, you could add the AD users or groups that belong to that KSAT group to the <strong>KB4-Group 1</strong> group. When you finish setting up this group, you can use this OU for the <strong>[sync.groups]</strong> or <strong>[sync.users]</strong> section of your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file. This method may be preferable because you will not need to change the existing groups in your AD account.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong>ADI does not support nested groups, which are groups that are members of other groups. However, ADI does support nested users, which are users who are members of nested groups.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2AV7Y2ZYPBQRVYM7KSCW6'>7. My organization has a proxy or firewall in place. How can I connect to ADI successfully?</h3>\n<p>You can integrate with Active Directory even if you're using a firewall or proxy. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115001905307.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Configure the ADI Sync Tool to Connect Through a Proxy</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2B1041T3QE3ACS8AAVCMX'>8. Where is my information being sent when using ADI sync?</h3>\n<p>When you import users with a CSV file, the <strong>users.json</strong> file is sent directly to the same servers that process imports. No other information is sent to the servers for processing. We intentionally leave the configuration data local to your system.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2BCKHQ31TSG0DS83EZHV0'>9. What happens if I enable the <strong>Show Group Domain</strong> setting in my KSAT <strong>Account Settings</strong>?</h3>\n<p>When you enable the <strong>Show Group Domain</strong> setting, ADI will add your domain name to your AD-synced KSAT groups. For example, a KSAT group named \"Accounting\" that is synced with the domain \"knowbe4.com\" would be named \"knowbe4.com\\Accounting\". If your users are split between multiple domain sources, this setting can help you organize your users.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2BKB3SRAG12TVC875H7N5'>10. My KSAT account is on test mode. What is test mode, and when should I turn it off?</h3>\n<p>After you set up ADI, your KSAT account will be on test mode until you turn it off. It's important that you leave your account on test mode so that you can preview what will happen when you sync your KSAT account with Active Directory. To view this preview, log in to your KSAT account, and navigate to <strong>Users</strong> &gt; <strong>Provisioning</strong>. From the <strong>Provisioning </strong>tab, you can view the changes that will be made after you enable ADI. Then, you can resolve any potential issues without affecting the users that you have in your KSAT account.</p>\n<p>We recommend that you wait until you are fully satisfied with the preview before you turn off test mode. You can find the <strong>Test Mode</strong> setting in the <strong>User Provisioning</strong> section of your <strong>Account Settings</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HFFDRG4G16HCSHSR21QYACDW'>Syncing Information</h2>\n<p>For syncing information about ADI, see the questions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href='#h_01HVM2CD6WATYT5A9NYA3DK284'>Can I change how often my AD information syncs to my KSAT account?</a></li>\n<li><a href='#h_01HVM2CM78WZYBME7MD7G7Q4VX'>Can I limit what data syncs to my KSAT account from Active Directory?

By default, the ADI sync service will sync your AD account to your KSAT account every six hours. If you need to force the sync to happen immediately, you can restart the ADI sync service. If you want to change the sync interval, you can change the information in the <strong>sync-interval</strong> field of your <strong>adisync.conf</strong> file.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The minimum sync interval is six hours (6h0m0s).</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2CM78WZYBME7MD7G7Q4VX'>2. Can I limit what data syncs to my KSAT account from Active Directory? How do I change which Active Directory fields ADI pulls data from?</h3>\n<p>Yes, you can limit the data that syncs to your KSAT account. In your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file, you will see an area with the settings below:</p>\n<div class='code-block'>\n<button class='copy-btn' data-target='text2'>Copy</button>\n<div id='text2'>\n<pre>[sync.fields]\ncomment = \"\"\ncustom-date-1 = \"\"\ncustom-date-2 = \"\"\ncustom-field-1 = \"\"\ncustom-field-2 = \"\"\ncustom-field-3 = \"\"\ncustom-field-4 = \"\"\ndepartment = \"department\"\ndivision = \"\"\nemployee-number = \"employeeNumber\"\nemployee-start-date = \"whenCreated\"\nfirst-name = \"givenName\"\nlast-name = \"\"\nlocation = \"physicalDeliveryOfficeName\"\nmanager = \"manager\"\nmobile-number = \"\"\norganization = \"o\"\nphone-number = \"telephoneNumber\"\ntitle = \"employeeNumber\"</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you don't want ADI to pull data for a field, you can leave the field blank or delete the field that is listed between the double quotation marks. Removing fields will not overwrite the existing data for those fields. If you want ADI to pull data from a different field, you can change the field between the double quotation marks to a different field where your user information exists. Fields are case-sensitive and must match the attribute name in your AD.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The <strong>mobile-number</strong> field in your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file will be blank because there is not a <strong>mobile-number</strong> field in Active Directory. However, you can enter the name of another field you want to pull the <strong>mobile-number</strong> data from. The two <strong>custom-date</strong> fields in your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file must follow the mm/dd/yyyy format.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2CW4DHA7CKYWH2HQRZQYQ'>3. How do I sync my AD groups with my KSAT groups?</h3>\n<p>The groups that sync to KSAT are based on security groups and distribution groups in Active Directory. If you want to sync AD groups with your KSAT account, you can add those groups to the <strong>[sync.groups]</strong> section of your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file. To add AD groups to your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf </strong>file, you can use one of the methods below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the groups you want to sync are in one or more OUs, enter the OUs into the <strong>includedOUs</strong> field of your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf </strong>file.</li>\n<li>If you want to sync specific groups, enter the groups into the <strong>includedGroups</strong> field of your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf </strong>file.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong>The users who are members of the groups included in the <strong>[sync.groups]</strong> section must also be included in the <strong>[sync.users]</strong> section of your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file. For example, if your AD group has 100 members and only 85 of those members are included in the <strong>[sync.users]</strong> field, only the 85 users will be added to the group in your KSAT account.</div>\n</div>\n<p>For more information about syncing users and groups, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228373888.html'>Defining Which OUs, Groups, and Users to Sync</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228373888.html'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2D27GSAWPTZDE7W2PFRNQ'>4. How often can I send a sync request for ADI API?</h3>\n<p>If test mode is enabled for your account, you can start and stop the ADI service as frequently as you'd like. Once you have turned off test mode, your ADI API sync request frequency is limited to once every six hours.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2D7M2264J21F88PADFHYZ'>5. How can I exclude expired AD accounts from my ADI sync?</h3>\n<p>To exclude AD accounts from syncing to your KSAT account based on the expiration date of the accounts, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify a date which expired accounts will be excluded before or on.</li>\n<li>Convert the date to Integer8 syntax.\n<ul>\n<li>If you need help converting the date to Integer8 syntax, you can use the conversion tools that are linked below:\n<p><a href='https://www.epochconverter.com/ldap' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>LDAP, Active Directory &amp; Filetime Timestamp Converter</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.silisoftware.com/tools/date.php' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Date format converter</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For an example of Integer8 syntax, see the table below:</p>\n<table style='margin-block-start: 1.5rem;'>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Standard Format</th>\n<th scope='col'>Integer 8 Syntax/th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>5/21/2017 10:41:52 AM Eastern Time (ET)</td>\n<td>131398513120000000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add the converted date to the <strong>filter_users_by_ou</strong> and <strong>filter_users_by_group</strong> fields in your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file. For example, see the section below, where XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX represents the date in Integer8 syntax:\n<div class='code-block'>\n<button class='copy-btn' data-target='text3'>Copy</button>\n<div id='text3'>\n<pre>filter_users_by_ou =\n\"(&amp;(|(accountExpires&gt;=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)(accountExpires=0))(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(mail=*)(!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2))(!(cn=HealthMailbox*))(!(cn=SystemMailbox*)))\"\"\nfilter_users_by_group =\n\"(&amp;(|(accountExpires&gt;=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)(accountExpires=0))(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(mail=*)(!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2))(!(cn=HealthMailbox*))(!(cn=SystemMailbox*))(|{DYNAMIC_CONTENT}))\"</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If you want to continuously exclude expired accounts, you will need to manually update the date in the <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file. For example, if you initially entered 11/20/2021 for the date and more accounts have expired since then, you will need to update the date in the <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file to account for the newly expired accounts.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2DQ1CGYXFW8DZAGY8A1B0'>6. How can I exclude AD accounts that haven't logged on in the past XX number of days in my sync?</h3>\n<p>You can exclude AD user accounts from syncing to your KSAT account based on the <strong>lastLogonTimeStamp</strong> AD account attribute.</p>\n<p>To exclude users from your sync based on a last login date, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify a date that you want to use as the last login date limit.</li>\n<li>Convert the date to Integer8 syntax.\n<ul>\n<li>If you need help converting the date to Integer8 syntax, you can use the conversion tools that are linked below:\n<p><a href='https://www.epochconverter.com/ldap' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>LDAP, Active Directory &amp; Filetime Timestamp Converter</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.silisoftware.com/tools/date.php' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Date format converter</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For an example of Integer8 syntax, see the table below:</p>\n<table style='margin-block-start: 1.5rem;'>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Standard Format</th>\n<th scope='col'>Integer 8 Syntax</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>5/21/2017 10:41:52 AM Eastern Time (ET)</td>\n<td>131398513120000000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add the converted date to the <strong>filter_users_by_ou</strong> and <strong>filter_users_by_group</strong> fields in your <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file.

If I add a user to a KSAT group and the user is not in that AD group, will the user be removed from the KSAT group during the next sync?</h3>\n<p>Yes, if the group is synced with your AD account. For example, if you add a user to a KSAT group that is not synced with your AD account, the user will remain in the KSAT group unless you remove the user. You can add both AD-managed and non AD-managed users to the KSAT group. However, if you sync the KSAT group with an AD group, the group will be managed by AD for AD-managed users. You can also add non AD-managed users to AD-managed groups, but the AD sync won\u2019t affect those users.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2EQ7M5CGWES36JHZK3RED'>8. Many user accounts in my Active Directory are disabled. Will these user accounts sync to my KSAT account?</h3>\n<p>No, users with disabled AD accounts will not sync to your KSAT account. However, if you want to sync disabled manager accounts, you can modify the LDAP filters in the <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf </strong>file.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2EWRWBAFA8D9624HJWTYX'>9. Why can't I sync contact objects with ADI?</h3>\n<p>ADI can only sync users or groups that are members of your Active Directory domain. Contact objects typically represent external users. Often, the primary purpose of contact objects is to appear in your organization's email address book so your users can send emails to external users. Contact objects are not part of your domain, and you cannot assign permissions to them.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2F1ZCYF2C78929JX9XGVM'>10. Will my users' passwords sync to my KSAT account?</h3>\n<p>No. ADI does not query your AD passwords, so no passwords will sync to your KSAT account.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2F7TZS2DPHEJBDBW3EHJV'>11.

For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228373888.html'>Defining Which OUs, Groups, and Users to Sync</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228373888.html'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If your users are split between multiple domains, you will need to verify that this location is specified in the <strong>[sync.users]</strong> section of each domain's <strong>&lt;domain&gt;.conf</strong> file.</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you need further assistance, contact our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/requests/new'>support team</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2HV594178PTC267KKRCE5'>6. Is there a file that I can download that shows sync errors and details?</h3>\n<p>Yes. You can download a text file that includes information about all of the sync changes and detailed information about any errors. You can download this file from the sync's <strong>Details </strong>page. To navigate to this file, follow the instructions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From your KSAT navigation panel, navigate to <strong>Users </strong>&gt; <strong>Provisioning</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Details</strong> button that is in the same row as the sync.</li>\n<li>Near the top-right corner of the page, click the <strong>Sync and Error Details</strong> link.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information about the <strong>Details</strong> page, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4408867460371.html'>Provisioning Subtab Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2J1BGCQJA65WKP2Z5V8Y6'>7. Why weren't my OUs added to KSAT as groups during my ADI sync?</h3>\n<p>OUs cannot be added as groups to KSAT. Only security and distribution groups will be added or synced as groups in KSAT. When you include OUs in the <strong>[sync.groups]</strong> section of your <strong>&lt;domain.conf&gt;</strong> file, only groups that are included in that OU will be added and synced to KSAT.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVM2J6YN6ZDK600GKK6SAHHG'>8. Why can't the ADI tool find any email addresses for my users?</h3>\n<p>ADI finds your users' email addresses in the <strong>proxyAddresses</strong> field of your Active Directory. If you are using a mail server other than Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft 365, the <strong>proxyAddresses</strong> field is most likely blank.</p>\n<p>To solve this issue, you will need to change the field where KSAT pulls email addresses from in your Active Directory, such as the <strong>mail</strong> attribute field. To learn how to change this field, see tour <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228373888.html'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>If you need further assistance, contact our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/requests/new'>support team</a>.</p>",

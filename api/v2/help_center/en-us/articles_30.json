If your organization uses the PAB, you can get started with PhishER quickly because your reported emails will be sent to PhishER automatically. You can decrease the setup time from the <strong>Rules</strong> tab in your PhishER platform, which offers system rules to help you start dispositioning emails quickly. For information to help you get started with PhishER, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360037250474.html'>PhishER Quickstart Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVSANT4HZZABDE2DANJFC8MN'>Do I need to use the Phish Alert Button (PAB) to forward emails to my PhishER Inbox?</h3>\n<p>As an alternative to using the PAB, you can manually forward users\u2019 reported emails to a reporting email address tied to your organization's PhishER platform.You can also download the EML file of an email, attach the EML file in a new email, and then send the email to PhishER. PhishER will recognize this process as a PAB report. If the <strong>Forwarded Only</strong> check box is selected for the reporting email address in your PhishER Settings, PhishER will recognize this process as a manual report. This method of email forwarding requires that forwarded emails are transmitted in an EML format, specifically the RFC 822 format. This format includes the complete headers and email body from the original email.</p>\n<p>For more information about these methods, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/16567660822163.html'>PhishER Settings: Account</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVSANG1ECEGFV0N42C03FMQK'>Is there a limit to how many reporting emails I can generate?</h3>\n<p>No. You can generate as many reporting email addresses as you would like. For example, you could create multiple reporting email addresses if your organization would like to use different reporting email addresses for different user groups, Phish Alert Button (PAB) instances, or office locations.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> All emails forwarded to your reporting email addresses are sent to your PhishER Inbox.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01HVSANB5EQNPTTAW9NRC5FJTP'>Where do I find my saved rooms?</h3>\n<p>After you save a room in PhishER, the room is stored under Saved Queries on the Rooms page.

Once the setting is enabled, the email must be quarantined by PhishRIP before it can be permanently deleted.

KnowBe4 has controls that prevent query tampering, wildcard searches, and access across accounts. The InfoSec team has tested these controls to ensure they are effective.</p>\n<p>PhishRIP communicates to Microsoft using a single-use Microsoft GraphAPI token that is not saved. PhishRIP has a limited number of fixed queries that can be made to a Microsoft 365 account, and these queries must match specific criteria from a message that has been reported to PhishER. All messages, queries, and query responses are encrypted. KnowBe4 employees are not allowed to access an organization's PhishER account without the organization's permission.</p>\n<p>PhishER provides a few ways to prevent your information from being lost or stolen when using PhishRIP.</p>\n<p>First, you can limit the access of the users that you add to the PhishER platform by creating Security Roles. You can use Security Roles to grant limited or full access to your users for the following console areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rooms</li>\n<li>Inbox</li>\n<li>Rules</li>\n<li>Actions</li>\n<li>PhishRIP</li>\n<li>Settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using Security Roles, you can specify which admins have the access to be able to initiate PhishRIP queries.</p>\n<p>Next, you can specify your <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360045742834.html'>customized criteria</a>, which PhishER uses to remove emails that are similar to any potentially threatening emails that have been sent to PhishER through the Phish Alert Button (PAB).</p>\n<p>Finally, if a message is quarantined and you discover that the message is actually clean, you can restore the message from your PhishER platform.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVSAK4B7WFEX5ZH5Y7K62NMP'>When a PhishFlip campaign is started, is the tracking duration always set to three days?

In your PhishER platform, you can configure your integration with your KSAT console to update events on KSAT User Timelines. Once certain PhishER actions are reported to your KSAT console, you can create a Smart Group that targets specific users based on how they treated real phishing emails. For example, you can create a <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8354913796115.html'>Smart Group</a> that searches for users who did not report threats. Then, you can use this information to create a targeted training campaign and to reiterate the importance of using the Phish Alert Button (PAB).</p>\n<p>For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/16569063307411.html'>KSAT Console</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/16569063307411.html'>PhishER Settings: Integrations</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVSADWB5PGBKD4FNF044GSN6'>What format of the PEM TLS certification is required for the PhishER TLS connection settings for Syslog?</h3>\n<p>The format of the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Transport Layer Security (TLS) certification should include the header, a new line, the certificate information, a new line, and the footer.

Then, PhishER sends an API call for each file or URL to VirusTotal to determine if the scan results are ready for each item. If VirusTotal is not ready to provide the scan results, PhishER must send additional API calls. As a result, PhishER must send a minimum of 3 requests per file or URL before a query can be retried.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HC01KYCW70P9FHEJCRBGGKR1'>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>For troubleshooting information about PhishER, see the questions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href='#h_01HVSAEAM2QH07M6V49960VA22'>What happens when a quarantine folder is deleted?</a></li>\n<li><a href='#h_01HVSAEEEQGAAKKSZG0WEJ2WZP'>Why do reported emails have null values?</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01HVSAEAM2QH07M6V49960VA22'>What happens when a quarantine folder is deleted?</h3>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: When a quarantine folder is deleted, anything in that folder will be deleted.

If you chose this option when you created the campaign and would like to remove a failure from this campaign, removing the failure will not remove the failing user from the group.

In the follow-up email, the cybercriminals claim that the sender forgot to include a link or attachment in the original email. However, the follow-up email isn\u2019t from the original sender but is actually from a cybercriminal, and the link or attachment is malicious.</p>\n<p>To help your users learn about this type of attack, you can create a clone phishing test. You can use your PhishER platform and KSAT console together to mimic clone phishing attacks.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HSBNN54XHT19F632XFQJJP31'>Create a Phishing Template with PhishER</h2>\n<p>We recommend creating a clone phishing template by using a real email that your users have reported.

However, we do recommend performing occasional maintenance checks on your Smart Groups. After you create a Smart Group, determine how often you need to check on that group. Generally, we recommend checking on your Smart Groups every six to twelve months, but you may need to check more frequently depending on the Smart Group. Also, make sure to consider the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8355402984851.html'>Time Frame Options</a> that you set for the Smart Group. If you set a <strong>Range</strong> in a criterion, determine whether you will need to update that range periodically to match your goals. If you set a <strong>Duration</strong> in a criterion, we recommend checking that criterion according to the duration you set. For example, the Smart Group below should be checked every three months:</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/DurationSmartGroupCriterion.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/DurationSmartGroupCriterion.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<p>We recommend that you create audit groups to easily verify that your automated processes are working properly. Audit groups are typically created to reflect the opposite of your automated process. For example, if you build an automated phishing process, your audit Smart Group should include users who have never received a Phishing Security Test (PST).

      "body": "<p>SecurityCoach is an add-on product for the KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training (KSAT) console that is available for our Platinum-level and Diamond-level customers to purchase. SecurityCoach can be used to coach your users about their behavior in real time using SecurityTips. You can customize your coaching experience by integrating your vendors, reviewing your detection rules, setting up real-time coaching campaigns, and choosing specific SecurityTip media and notifications to send to your users.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>You can use SecurityTips to warn users about their risky behaviors or to reward users for practicing good security behaviors. For example, if a user successfully reports a simulated phishing test, you can send a SecurityTip to congratulate them for spotting the phishing signs.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Before you can begin monitoring user behavior and coaching your users in real time, you will need to set up SecurityCoach in your KSAT console. To set up SecurityCoach, you must configure your vendor integrations, set up a delivery method for your SecurityTips, review your rule detections, and create a real-time coaching campaign.</p>\n<p>To learn more about setting up SecurityCoach, see the subsections below.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>To view a SecurityCoach product demo, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000937648.html'>KnowBe4 Product Demos</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PTY6EJJTCSDBD16BZ2'>Configuring Security Vendor Integrations</h2>\n<p>First, you'll need to set up your third-party vendor integrations in the <strong>SecurityCoach </strong>&gt; <strong>Setup</strong> tab of your KSAT console. Once you set up a vendor integration, the vendor's data will be available in SecurityCoach. You can use this data to begin monitoring user behaviors.</p>\n<p>For more information about setting up vendor integrations in SecurityCoach, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/sections/10969917980435'>Setting Up Integrations</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PT214EVB87E4WSKH2M'>Adding a Delivery Method</h2>\n<p>Email is pre-configured as the default delivery method for SecurityCoach. If you coach your users via email, SecurityTips will be sent to their user email address that is set in the <strong>Users</strong> tab of your KSAT console.</p>\n<p><br>SecurityCoach also supports integrations with Google Chat, Microsoft Teams, and Slack. If your organization uses any of these platforms for communication, we recommend configuring one as your primary delivery method, so you can coach your users where they communicate most often.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>If Google Chat, Microsoft Teams, or Slack are set as the primary delivery method, email can be used as a backup delivery method.</div>\n</div>\n<p>For more information on setting up delivery methods, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/sections/20416205509011-Configuring-Delivery-Methods'>Configuring Delivery Methods</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PT5HHCX6F30SFH3W05'>Mapping Users</h2>\n<p>Mapping your users to identifiers, such as a hostname, helps link user behavior to specific users. User mapping is done automatically for email and web security vendors using the user email addresses set in the <strong>Users</strong> tab of your KSAT console. You may also need to map additional identifiers for your endpoint security vendors. For example, you may need to map users to their hostnames, usernames, or device IDs.</p>\n<p>You can configure mapping rules to automatically map users for you, manually map users by uploading a CSV file, or use a combination of both methods. SecurityCoach also provides mapping recommendations for you to review.</p>\n<p>For more information about mapping users, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/7156417916307.html'>Map Users in SecurityCoach</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PTHPMWP7FNS5T810AG'>Reviewing Rule Detections</h2>\n<p>SecurityCoach provides system detection rules for each security vendor. Detection rules identify which user behaviors you would like to track using the data provided by your integrated vendors. When you integrate a vendor, these detection rules are enabled automatically, but you can also create custom detection rules for your organization's needs.</p>\n<p>We recommend reviewing your top detection rules and prioritizing the user behaviors you want to target with your real-time coaching campaigns.

However, the vendor contact who is listed in the <strong>Contact Email</strong> field is the only person who will receive email notifications about questionnaires.</p>\n<p>For more information about adding vendor contacts, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360021501394.html' target='_self'>Organization Contact Details</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360021501394.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage Vendor Profiles</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Vendor Dashboard</strong></p>\n<p>The Vendor Dashboard provides an overview of the potential risk that your vendors pose for your organization, as well as an overview of your organization's questionnaires and questionnaire issues.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Vendor Dashboard, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360033994834.html' target='_self'>How to Use the Vendor Dashboard</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Vendor Issue</strong></p>\n<p>You can create a vendor issue when you review a vendor\u2019s questionnaire responses and want to request additional information or to address a concern.</p>\n<p>For more information about vendor issues, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360033813974.html' target='_self'>Creating Issues</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360033813974.html' target='_self'>How to Review Questionnaires and Create Issues</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Vendor Profile</strong></p>\n<p>A vendor profile includes any information about a vendor that administrators have added to your account. Administrators can create vendor profiles by entering information into the <strong>Vendor Details</strong> page, or they can create vendor profiles by importing a CSV file.</p>\n<p>For more information about vendor profiles, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360021501394.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage Vendor Profiles</a> article.</p>\n<p><strong>Vendor Score</strong></p>\n<p>A vendor score is the average score of all questionnaires that the vendor has completed. You can use vendor scores to determine whether you need to continue assessing a vendor or whether you need to request additional information from a vendor. Generally, higher scores indicate that the vendor has a lower risk level, and lower scores indicate that the vendor has a higher risk level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about the vendor score, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360021501394.html' target='_self'>Working With Vendor Profiles</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360021501394.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage Vendor Profiles</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Vendor Status</strong></p>\n<p>Vendor statuses can indicate your organization's involvement with a vendor. You can use these statuses to organize the vendors in your platform.</p>\n<p>See the list below for details about each vendor status.\u00a0</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Active</strong>: You may change the vendor status to Active if your organization is currently working with the vendor. You can send the vendor questionnaires if the vendor\u2019s status is Active.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Inactive</strong>: You may change the vendor status to Inactive if your organization is not currently working with the vendor.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Incomplete</strong>: When you import a vendor, the vendor\u2019s status defaults to Incomplete. You may also change the vendor status to Incomplete as a reminder to add information to the vendor profile.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pending Approval</strong>: When you create a new vendor, the vendor\u2019s status defaults to Pending Approval. You can also manually set this status before deciding whether you want to work with a vendor. You can send the vendor questionnaires if the vendor\u2019s status is Pending Approval.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Rejected</strong>: You may use this status after you receive a vendor\u2019s questionnaire and decide not to work with the vendor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vendor User</strong></p>\n<p>A vendor user is a user role that only has access to questionnaires, issues, and files that KCM GRC administrators have added to the <strong>Attachments</strong> tab of the <strong>Vendor Details</strong> page. Vendor users do not have access to any other information in your organization's account, and they do not count against your licensed seat count for KCM GRC. To access questionnaires, vendor users must sign in to a separate portal that is associated with your account. You can add vendor users from the <strong>Contacts</strong> tab of the <strong>Vendor Details</strong> page.</p>\n<p>For more information about creating vendor users, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360021501394.html' target='_self'>Adding User Accounts for Vendor Contacts</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360021501394.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage Vendor Profiles</a> article.\u00a0</p>",

These strict privacy controls exist in our application code to ensure data privacy and prevent one customer from accessing another customer's data. This is done using unique account identifiers which attribute each user to a specific account. We have many unit and integration tests in place to ensure these privacy controls work as intended. We run these tests every time our codebase is updated. Even one single test failure will prevent new code from being shipped to production.</span></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JNP7651DF0N6G8HCH32YKQB6'>\u00a0</h2>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>2.

The change control process is designed to enforce key development controls each time a change is made to the software, including development and emergency changes. The change management process begins with the identification of what needs to be changed; recording and classification of the change; and continues with the review, approval, test, and staging for implementation of the change. Once implementation has been completed, measured, and reported, the change process is complete.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>5.

We have a daily process that anonymizes our entire production database. This process is overseen by our data privacy and infosec teams. This anonymized database includes anonymized customer account details, such as a customer's address, domain, company name, personal data, and other confidential information. This anonymized database is used for testing as necessary. We refresh this database daily so that when account data is deleted or purged, the account data is also purged from the anonymized database.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>6.

How does KnowBe4 ensure the availability of its product?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>Our systems run in the cloud and do not run their own routers, load balancers, DNS servers, or virtual systems. Except for a few data sub-processors, services, and data, data is hosted primarily in Amazon AWS data centers. For US-based customers and customers wanting to keep their data residing in the US, we have systems in AWS data centers located in the US region in North Virginia. For customers based in the EU/EEA (including UK and Switzerland), we have systems located in AWS data centers that store production data in DC Dublin, Ireland with a failover in DC Frankfurt. However, a few data sub-processors will process a limited subset of data in the United States. A full accounting of data processing locations can be found in our sub-processor listing.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>Our systems are built taking both business continuity and disaster recovery into consideration. Our IT infrastructure, including systems and databases, is spread across multiple Amazon AWS data centers (availability zones) for both the EU and US regions for continuity purposes. Systems are within our own virtual private cloud (VPC) with network access control lists (ACLs) to prevent unauthorized requests from gaining access to the internal network.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>We use the AWS Fargate platform as a service. AWS Fargate is a serverless computer engine for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) that allows KnowBe4 to run containers without having to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines (VMs). AWS Fargate manages the underlying infrastructure and clusters. It also automatically scales the application based on demand. AWS Fargate eliminates the need to scale, monitor, patch, and secure EC2 instances.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>Data communication between our backend systems and our customers' backend systems is encrypted, which protects data in transit. Data is held in an encrypted Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), which provides for availability and data durability. Storage is provided by encrypted Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets dedicated to KnowBe4. Encryption is enabled to protect data at rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>10. How does KnowBe4 ensure the confidentiality of our data?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>Our internal network is protected from public internet traffic via stateful inspection firewalls provided by Amazon AWS. A security group acts as a firewall and controls the traffic allowed into a group of instances. For each security group, custom rules are added that govern the allowed inbound traffic to instances in the group. All other inbound traffic is denied.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>Encrypted communication is utilized to protect remote internet sessions to our applications and internal network. Encryption is used to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data being passed over the public network.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>All data is transmitted over secure channels. This includes access to the Service Provider Training console website, information sent to third parties for processing, and logging. Data that is sent between the web server and the database is done within a virtual private cloud within AWS.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>Data sent between our applications and our customers' applications is forced through at minimum HTTPS TLS 1.2 (it will default to the highest level of TLS available) connection using modern ciphers. The database instance is encrypted with the AES256 encryption standard.</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>11.

The purpose of the Risk Management module is for you to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks. You can add risks to your Risk Register by using the Risk Wizard, creating custom risks, and importing custom risks. When you create custom risks, you can assign an impact, a likelihood, a status, and a tag to the risks. You can also add additional details to risks, including a description, a category, consequences, and an affected asset.

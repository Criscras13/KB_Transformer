In the community, you can connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on new ideas with other admins, partners, and employees. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/15480944821395' target='_self'>KnowBe4 Community Guide</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>In this guide, you\u2019ll learn how to set up SecurityCoach in four easy steps. By following these steps, you can start detecting risky activity and coach your users in real time.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>If your organization uses user provisioning, make sure your organization is using the latest version to get the most out of SecurityCoach. For more information about user provisioning, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/228373888' target='_self'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide</a> or our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052380374' target='_self'>SCIM Configuration Guide</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>As you complete each step, you can mark it as complete in the SecurityCoach Setup section of your dashboard. To view your dashboard, navigate to <strong>SecurityCoach</strong> &gt; <strong>Dashboard</strong>.</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/SecurityCoach/Dashboard/EN/SecurityCoachSetupSection.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/SecurityCoach/Dashboard/EN/SecurityCoachSetupSection.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<p>If you would like more detailed instructions, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/6654432814355' target='_self'>SecurityCoach Product Manual</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HCJP3RKV53KAVHT0X2WFPN65'>Step One: Integrate Vendors</h2>\n<p>SecurityCoach is integrated automatically with KSAT, but you can also set up integrations with your other security vendors. Once you set up these integrations, you can begin monitoring for risky activities using the data from your security vendors.</p>\n<p>To set up your security vendor integrations, click <strong>Integrate Vendors</strong> on the <strong>SecurityCoach Setup</strong> task list or navigate to <strong>SecurityCoach</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Security Vendor Integrations</strong>. Then, configure the integrations that you would like to use in your organization. For detailed instructions on setting up vendor integrations, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/sections/10969917980435-Vendor-Integration-Guides' target='_self'>Vendor Integration Guides</a>.</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/security_coach/security_coach_setup.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/security_coach/security_coach_setup.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<h2 id='h_01HCJP3RKV6YJ3VP64ZPNTP7N7'>Step Two: Add Delivery Method (Optional)</h2>\n<p>Next, we recommend setting up a delivery method to send SecurityTips to your users. SecurityTips include a text notification and media to coach your users about risky activity and how to avoid it in the future.</p>\n<p>Email is automatically available as a delivery method. However, we recommend adding Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Google Chat to coach your users where they communicate most.</p>\n<p>To get started, click <strong>Add Delivery Method</strong> on the <strong>SecurityCoach Setup</strong> task list or navigate to <strong>SecurityCoach</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Delivery Setup</strong>. Then, select the delivery method you would like to set up. For detailed instructions, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/7157787612819'>Slack Integration Guide for SecurityCoach</a>, <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/7157869422099'>Microsoft Teams Integration Guide for SecurityCoach</a>, or <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/21452968565523'>Google Chat Integration Guide with SecurityCoach</a>.</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/SecurityCoach/Setup/DeliverySetup/EN/DeliverySetupPage.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/SecurityCoach/Setup/DeliverySetup/EN/DeliverySetupPage.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<h2 id='h_01HCJP3RKVZYZP0M6CCWZQ5ZER'>Step Three: Review Rule Detections (Optional)</h2>\n<p>SecurityCoach provides system detection rules for each security vendor. Detection rules identify what risky activity you would like to track using the data provided by your integrated vendors.</p>\n<p>These detection rules are enabled automatically, but you can also create custom detection rules if needed. For more information about detection rules, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/7159083016723'>Creating and Managing Detection Rules</a> article.</p>\n<p>We recommend reviewing your top detection rules so that you prioritize what risky activities to target with your real-time coaching campaigns.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>Enabled detection rules do not automatically send SecurityTips to your users. You must create a real-time coaching campaign to send SecurityTips.</div>\n</div>\n<p>You can review your <strong>Top Detection Rules</strong> in the <strong>Detection Rules Report</strong>. To view this report, click <strong>Review Detection Rules</strong> on the <strong>SecurityCoach Setup</strong> task list or navigate to <strong>SecurityCoach</strong> &gt; <strong>Reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Detection Rules Report</strong> &gt; <strong>Report</strong>. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/7159155080851'>SecurityCoach Reporting Overview</a> article.</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/SecurityCoach/Reports/EN/DetectionRulesReport_TopDetectionRules.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/SecurityCoach/Reports/EN/DetectionRulesReport_TopDetectionRules.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<h2 id='h_01HCJP3RKV55G0CVY84MJ29628'>Step Four: Create a Real-Time Coaching Campaign</h2>\n<p>Finally, you can create a real-time coaching campaign. Real-time coaching campaigns send SecurityTips to users when risky activity is detected on their devices.</p>\n<p>To create a real-time coaching campaign, click <strong>Create Real-Time Coaching Campaigns</strong> on the <strong>SecurityCoach Setup</strong> task list or navigate to <strong>SecurityCoach</strong> &gt; <strong>Real-Time Coaching</strong>. On the <strong>Real-Time Coaching</strong> page, you can create real-time coaching campaigns based on our recommendations or create your own custom real-time coaching campaigns.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>If you're not ready to coach your entire organization, you can create a <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/30053728045459'>test mode campaign</a> to see how your campaign will perform before you begin coaching your users.</div>\n</div>\n<p>For more information about setting up real-time coaching campaigns, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/7159255924371'>Creating and Managing Real-Time Coaching Campaigns</a> article.</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/SecurityCoach/RealTimeCoaching/EN/RealTimeCoachingCreateCampaign.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/SecurityCoach/RealTimeCoaching/EN/RealTimeCoachingCreateCampaign.png' alt=' '></a></div>",

Gaming features can include badges, points, rankings, rewards, and more.</p>\n<p>Gamification has been shown to improve user engagement by increasing people\u2019s inherent ambition to compete, achieve, or master. When people are motivated to complete a task, they learn better and retain more information.</p>\n<p>KnowBe4\u2019s addition of gamification includes leaderboards and badges. Leaderboards allow users to see how they rank up against their peers, promoting friendly competition. Badges will provide users with unexpected rewards after their training to remind them that they\u2019ve accomplished something important. Continue to read below for more details about leaderboards and badges.</p>\n<p>Click <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360016839214.html'>here</a> to watch a short, animated video explaining gamification in the KnowBe4 console.

See <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Wikipedia: Gamification</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01AKGAYN7CRFDY643EYHNV'>Leaderboards</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Leaderboard</strong> tab encourages users to compete with their colleagues and show off their security awareness skills. You can enable a group leaderboard based on training completion or an individual leaderboard based on the usage of the Phish Alert Button (PAB). To learn more about these leaderboards, continue reading this article. To learn how to enable leaderboards, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/12734085457555.html'>KnowBe4 Console Account Settings: Training</a> article.</p>\n<p>If you would like to educate your users on how the leaderboards work, we recommend sharing the resources listed below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360012723514.html'>Learner Support: Leaderboard Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360016839414.html'>Video: Cyber Hero Training: Leaderboards</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id='h_01HKB00CE28BT0ZY0JCFA1VYSC'>Individual Leaderboard</h4>\n<p>On the individual leaderboard, users compete with their colleagues on how well they use the Phish Alert Button (PAB). Users earn points based on the percentage of simulated phishing emails they report and how quickly they\u2019re reported. For more information about this point system, see the <strong>Detailed Point Calculation</strong> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360012723514.html'>Learner Support: Leaderboards Guide</a>.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important: </strong>If you delete a campaign, the points users earned from it will be deducted from the user\u2019s total points on the leaderboard.

Groups are ranked according to the percentage of training completed. This percentage is calculated by dividing the number of completed training assignments for each group member by their total number of training assignments.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/learner_experience/leaderboard.png'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/learner_experience/leaderboard.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>Before enabling the group leaderboard, be sure to create the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010243207.html'>user groups</a> you would like to use. You can create groups based on any criteria you would like. Some common groupings are by manager, department, office, or region.

When people are intrinsically motivated to complete a task, they learn better and retain more information.

All groups that have a 100% completion rate will be ranked depending on how fast all users within that group completed the training.</p>\n<p><strong>How is the language for individual courses determined</strong></p>\n<p>If a course is not available in the language you selected for the interface, our system takes other factors into consideration when it comes to setting the default language for each course. These factors include the default language your administrator set, the language set in your browser, as well as what other languages you have selected for courses you have taken previously. However, the language you set for your LX, using the language drop-down menu on the top left of the LX, will override all other factors as long as you have not previously set it. Courses you have already started will remain defaulted to the language you originally started the course in.</p>\n<p><strong>How long are completed modules available in the user's \u2018Training\u2019 tab in the Learner Experience?</strong></p>\n<p>Modules are only listed in the user\u2019s Training tab in the Learner Experience while a campaign is active.</p>",

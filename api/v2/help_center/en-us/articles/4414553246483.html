Question:</strong> Is it better for a vendor to have a higher or lower vendor score?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Generally, the higher the vendor score, the lower the risk that is associated with working with the vendor. Vendors are scored for each questionnaire based on the number of questions they answer correctly. The vendor score is the average score of all questionnaires that the vendor has completed. Vendors who answer questions correctly will typically have higher vendor scores, unless you manually modify your vendors' vendor scores.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about modifying vendor scores, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021501394#ModifyVendorScore' target='_self'>Modifying Vendor Scores</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021501394' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage Vendor Profiles</a> article.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><a name='CONTACT_EMAIL'></a></p>\n<p><strong>2. Question:</strong> I'm creating a vendor. Will my vendor receive an email when I add their email address to the <strong>Contact Email</strong> field?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, a vendor will not receive emails from KCM GRC until when you add their email address to the <strong>Contact Email</strong> field. Before the vendor begins receiving emails from KCM GRC, you will need to create a vendor user account for them.</p>\n<p>To learn how to create a vendor user account, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021501394#AddVendorUser' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Adding User Accounts for Vendor Contacts</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021501394' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage Vendor Profiles</a> article.</p>\n<p><a name='DATA_TYPES'></a></p>\n<p><strong>3. Question:</strong> I'm creating a vendor and don't know which data types to select in the <strong>Data Types</strong> field. What does each data type mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can find the abbreviation, full form name, and description of each data type in the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021501394#ORGCONTACTDETAILS' target='_self'>Organization Contact Details</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021501394' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage Vendor Profiles</a> article.</p>\n<p><a name='ATTACHMENTS'></a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Question:</strong> How can I use the <strong>Attachments</strong> tab on the <strong>Vendor Details</strong> page?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>You can use the <strong>Attachments</strong> tab to upload files for vendor users to view. Vendor users cannot upload files to this tab.</p>\n<p>When a vendor user signs in to their KCM GRC account, the files that you upload in the <strong>Attachments</strong> tab will appear in the <strong>Documents\u00a0</strong>section of the vendor user's dashboard.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a name='LOGIN'></a></p>\n<p><strong>5. Question:</strong> Where should my vendors log in to complete questionnaires that I assigned to them?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> When you assign a questionnaire to a vendor, the vendor user can click the link in the email they receive. You can also send the URL that you use to log in to your KCM GRC account to the vendor. When the vendor user clicks the URL, they will be navigated to the login page where they can enter their credentials. The vendor user's login credentials will direct them to the vendor portal, which the vendor user can use to complete the questionnaire.</p>\n<p>For more information about the vendor user experience, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021761873' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>How to Complete Questionnaires and Respond to Issues: A Guide for Vendor Users</a> article.</p>\n<p><a name='QUESTIONNAIRES'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J8J4RVJMXN7C94TKRGPF0K1H'>Questionnaires</h2>\n<p>For information about working with questionnaires in your platform, see the questions below:</p>\n<p><a href='#EDIT_QUESTIONNAIRE'>1.

Phishing activity reports display comprehensive information about your users' Phishing Security Test (PST) results. You can also customize the reports to display specific data, such as PST data for individual user groups.</p>\n<p>If you would like to export your <strong>Phishing Activity Reports </strong>for future use, you can export information from the report as a CSV file or export a report overview graph as a PDF file.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>Data from your KSAT console can take up to 24 hours to process and display in your phishing activity reports.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='iv_01H7WRB3C9Z49H0JT0W7G8VRX1'>Customizing Phishing Activity Reports</h2>\n<p>When you create a phishing activity report, you can apply filters to the report to view specific data.

To view the exact numbers for each of these PSTs, you can hover your mouse over the bar graph. You can also remove a bar from the graph by clicking the corresponding label in the legend at the bottom of the graph. For example, you can click <strong>Failed</strong> from the legend to remove the <strong>Failed</strong> bar from the graph.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/Phishing+Activity+Report/Phishing+Activity+Report_All+Activity+Graph.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/Phishing+Activity+Report/Phishing+Activity+Report_All+Activity+Graph.png' alt='All Phishing Activity Graph'></a></p>\n<p>Below the graph, you can view a table that displays information about the phishing campaigns that each user is enrolled in.

For callback campaigns available to Diamond subscriptions, the bar graph can also be used to monitor callbacks and callback data entered. To view the exact numbers for each of these events, you can hover your mouse over each bar in the bar graph. Next to the bar graph, you can also view the average Phish-prone Percentage, Phish-failure Percentage, and PAB-reported percentage.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/Phishing+Activity+Report/Phishing+Activity+Report_Grouped+by+User+Graph.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/Phishing+Activity+Report/Phishing+Activity+Report_Grouped+by+User+Graph.png' alt='Grouped by User Graph'></a></p>\n<p>Below the graph, you can view a table that displays information about the phishing campaigns that each user is enrolled in. The table contains one row for each user by combining the data for all of the phishing campaigns the user is enrolled in. For example, if a user is enrolled in one phishing campaign that includes three PSTs, the report will combine the data for the three PSTs into one row for the user.</p>\n<p>You can customize the table by selecting columns to display and sort your results.

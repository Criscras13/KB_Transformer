    "body": "<p>Our training campaign notifications can be used to notify users, managers, and KSAT console admins of a user's enrollment in or progress on a training campaign.</p>\n<p>We have two main categories of notifications: automated and manual. Automated notifications are set up when creating or editing your campaign details. Manual notifications can be sent at any time during your users' enrollment period, from under your training campaign's overview page or reports page.</p>\n<p><span>Select the links below to learn more about training notifications, including detailed explanations for each notification type. Alternatively, you can watch</span> our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115008190288.html'>Automated Training Notifications</a> and our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115008033407.html'>Manual Training Notifications</a> videos.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note: </strong>When notifications are enabled for large training campaigns, KnowBe4's system automatically staggers email delivery. This approach helps protect email servers, improve deliverability, avoid spam filters, and maintain system performance. This method is particularly useful for navigating greylisting settings, which might block multiple simultaneous connections from the same IP addresses.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1VEPKG5BG1ZB1WDRFFX0G2'>Automated Notifications</h2>\n<p>You can set up automated notifications while creating or editing a new training campaign.</p>\n<p>To set up automated notifications when you create a campaign, select the <strong>+ Add Notification</strong> button on the <strong>Create New Training Campaign</strong> page. You can also add automated notifications when you edit an existing campaign from the <strong>Edit Training Campaign</strong> page.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/TrainingNotifications/AutomaticTrainingNotifications.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/TrainingNotifications/AutomaticTrainingNotifications.png' alt=' ' width='601' height='305'></a></p>\n<p>You can edit or add automated notifications for a campaign already in progress, but these notifications will not be sent retroactively. Alternatively, you could use a <a href='#MANUAL' target='_self'>manual training notification</a> to send a new notification for a campaign in progress.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have users who miss their training deadline and you want to allow them to complete the training after it's due, you can add Past Due notifications to your campaign.

For best results, we recommend keeping the start and end times within the business hours set in your KSAT <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/226457887.html'>Account Settings</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS1VEPKGKWM3P1C1WZ1ABN9V'>Automated Notification Types</h3>\n<p>For details about each automated notification type, use the tabs below to select the recipient.</p>\n<div class='js-tabs'>\n<div title='User Notifications'>\n<h3 id='h_01HS1VEPKG3WJMDP8P2S3ER3SZ'>User Notifications</h3>\nThe chart below outlines each type of notification that can be sent to users.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Business hours are based on the business hours and time zone in your KSAT <strong>Account Settings</strong>.

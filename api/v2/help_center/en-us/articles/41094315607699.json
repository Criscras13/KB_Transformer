    "body": "<p>Smart Groups allow admins to categorize individuals based on profile attributes, actions, and risk levels. Once created, these groups can be used to schedule testing, training, and communication.</p>\n<p>Key benefits of Smart Groups in reporting include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Comparison</strong>: Enabling the sorting of users by profile details, actions, and risk assessments.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Analysis</strong>: Filtering reports using Smart Groups to identify trends.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Action</strong>: Utilizing Smart Groups for subsequent actions and interventions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JTTPVWC0BQQCQK3MVN65BZZT'>Reporting Use Cases with Smart Groups</h2>\n<p>There are several ways you can use Smart Groups with reporting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>User History</strong>: Reviewing phishing and training performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Profile Attributes</strong>: Filtering by location, job title, or department.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Creation Date</strong>: Comparing recent hires with long-term employees.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>PhishER Data</strong>: Examining interactions with actual threat emails.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To track security objectives, it's helpful to convert those objectives into Smart Groups. For example, you can monitor repeat reporters by creating Smart Groups that monitor users who have reported phishing emails multiple times within specified quarterly periods.</p>\n<p>For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8355410440211.html'>Smart Groups Reporting Automation Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JTTPY7CZNRGBF0TF4CQVCYMA'>Creating Reports to Answer Specific Questions</h2>\n<p>Reports can address specific questions about various data points, such as regional phishing performance, failure trends over time, and quarterly progress.

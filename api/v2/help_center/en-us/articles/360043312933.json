    "body": "<p>In your PhishER platform, you can use PhishML to disposition messages and prioritize email threats from your users\u2019 inboxes. PhishML is a machine-learning feature that analyzes messages in your PhishER Inbox and determines the percentage of certainty, or <a href='#h_01HD4XH6A5M87N23KB90D8YN60'>confidence value</a>, that each message is clean, spam, or a threat.</p>\n<p>PhishML allows you to set the thresholds that a message\u2019s confidence values must meet or exceed to qualify for automatic dispositioning. Then, you can create <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/13195730767635' target='_self'>actions</a> that use PhishML tags to automate the dispositioning and prioritization of messages in your PhishER Inbox.</p>\n<p>PhishML is continuously learning and improving its accuracy based the language used in the content of reported emails. PhishML only learns from the reported phishing emails that are sent to KnowBe4 when you enable the <strong>Send Us a Copy</strong> setting in the <strong>Phish Alert</strong> section of your KSAT <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/12769050560403'>Account Settings</a>. After extracting text and ignoring embedded content in messages, PhishML compares the language to patterns observed from other messages analyzed in PhishER.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HD4XH6A5ZSBWZQ8NT4SSAM5J'>Enabling PhishML</h2>\n<p>To enable PhishML for your PhishER platform, follow the steps below:</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/GettingStarted/Settings/PML-enabled.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/GettingStarted/Settings/PML-enabled.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your PhishER platform.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>PhishML</strong>.</li>\n<li>Turn on the <strong>Enable PhishML</strong> toggle.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The first time you enable PhishML, a Terms and Conditions dialog box will appear. Prior to using PhishML, you are required to review and accept KnowBe4's <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/privacy-policy' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Privacy Policy</a> and <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/terms' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Terms of Service</a>. Once you have reviewed both items, click <strong>I Accept</strong>.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Select the check box next to each category that you would like PhishML to provide a confidence value for when it analyzes a message.</li>\n<li>(Optional) To set a custom threshold value for each category, click and drag the interactive slider to the left or right. For more information, see the <a href='#h_01HD4XH6A5M87N23KB90D8YN60'>Setting Confidence Values and Thresholds</a> section below.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to update your PhishML settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01HD4XH6A5M87N23KB90D8YN60'>Setting Confidence Values and Thresholds</h2>\n<p>PhishML generates three confidence values for each message that it analyzes. Confidence values represent the percentage of certainty that a message is clean, spam, or a threat. You can view the confidence values of a message from the <strong>Actions</strong> subtab of the sidebar on the <strong>Message Details</strong> page.</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/GettingStarted/Settings/PML-Confidence_Actions.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/GettingStarted/Settings/PML-Confidence_Actions.png' alt=' ' width='314' height='219'></a></div>\n<p>A confidence threshold is the minimum percentage of certainty that PhishML must meet or exceed for a message to tag it as clean, spam, or a threat. PhishML only applies tags to qualifying messages if the confidence threshold is active. From your PhishER <strong>Settings</strong>, you can enable or disable confidence thresholds. Once you enable a confidence threshold, you can click and drag the slider next to it to set a custom threshold value. Each confidence threshold can be set to any custom value between 51 and 100. By default, each confidence threshold value is set to 95.</p>\n<p>We recommend setting a lower confidence threshold value of less than 80 if you would like to increase the number of messages that are automatically tagged by PhishML as clean, spam, or a threat. We suggest setting a lower confidence threshold for PhishML to identify messages that are either spam or a threat. This setting allows PhishER admins to quickly resolve or eliminate safe messages and prioritize messages that need further analysis or review.</p>\n<p>We recommend setting a higher confidence threshold value of higher than 85 if you would like to decrease the number of messages that are tagged by PhishML as clean, spam, or a threat. We suggest setting a higher confidence threshold for PhishML to identify messages that are clean. This setting allows PhishER admins to prioritize messages that need further analysis or review.</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/GettingStarted/Settings/PML-enabled.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/GettingStarted/Settings/PML-enabled.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>PhishML's confidence values are only based on analysis of a message\u2019s contents. PhishML doesn\u2019t inspect URLs, attachments, or images. If you have a VirusTotal account integrated with PhishER, you can use VirusTotal to inspect URLs and attachments. Using both PhishML and VirusTotal allows you to better analyze and classify messages.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HD4XH6A5SJ4PAAVCC20W0EA4'>PhishML Tags</h2>\n<p>Based on its analysis, PhishML applies a tag to each of your messages. From the <strong>Actions</strong> subtab of the sidebar on the <strong>Message Details</strong> page, you can view the tag that PhishML attached to a message. You can also add and remove tags. To learn about the PhishML tags, see the list below:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>PML:CLEAN</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when PhishML determines that a message is clean based on your confidence threshold.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>PML:SPAM</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when PhishML determines that a message is spam based on your confidence threshold.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>PML:THREAT</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when PhishML determines that a message is a threat based on your confidence threshold.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>PML:BYPASSED</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when PhishML times out. You can retry by re-running rules and actions against the message. Then, if PhishML is successful, the appropriate tag will be added to the message.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If you have a PhishER Plus subscription, you can use PhishML Insights to learn more about how PhishML determines a message\u2019s disposition.

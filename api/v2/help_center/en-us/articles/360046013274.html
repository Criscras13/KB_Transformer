Sometimes these differences can cause a false positive click.Here are some common causes of false positives on mobile devices:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Some mail clients allow you to preview a website through before opening a link. Though the user didn't click the link, this preview option may register as a click since the device accessed the link for the preview.</li>\n<li>Some mobile devices have their own endpoint protection and antivirus software. When this software scans the phishing link, it can register as a click.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note</strong><span>: If your false positives only occur with PDF phishing templates, consider hiding these from your console. Search for \u201cPDF\u201d within the System Templates and then follow the instructions outlined </span><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/228001628-How-Do-I-Hide-Templates-or-Categories-I-Don-t-Want-to-Use-' target='_self'>here</a><span>.</span> <span>If a false positive occurs and you wish to remove the failure, please see </span><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001214287-How-to-Remove-Failures-from-Phishing-Reports'><span>How to Remove Failures from Phishing Reports</span></a><span>.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HVRR81P628GJZJ0NMFJNKBVV'>When using a mobile device, can I hover over a link in an email to check the URL?</h2>\n<p>For most mobile devices, you can tap and hold, or \u201clong press\u201d, on a link to display a menu. The menu will show the destination URL at the top, options on what to do with the URL, and sometimes a preview of the website. If you have trouble with this feature, try checking the support website for your specific device.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important: </strong>If your device displays a preview of the website when you long press, this\u00a0could result in\u00a0<a href='#FALSE' target='_self'>false positive phishing test results</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Alternatively, you can look for other red flags before you click:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Were you expecting an email with a link from this sender?</li>\n<li>Was this email sent during normal business hours?</li>\n<li>Does this email have a sense of urgency?</li>\n</ul>",

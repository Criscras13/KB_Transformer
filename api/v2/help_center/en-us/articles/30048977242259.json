Your actual Risk Score won't change, but its risk level label may shift to reflect our new benchmarks better.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Our SmartRisk Agent\u2122 feature provides more in-depth analysis with tailored recommendations to help you better understand your organization\u2019s security strengths and weaknesses. You can use SmartRisk Agent\u2122 to learn which users may be more vulnerable to phishing attacks and review the effectiveness of your security awareness training program.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>Data for our SmartRisk Agent\u2122 is available from February 2024 onwards.</div>\n</div>\n<p>SmartRisk Agent\u2122 assigns dynamic Risk Scores to your users, groups, and organization. You can use these Risk Scores to make data-driven decisions for your organization's security.</p>\n<p>KnowBe4 records a unique Risk Score for your users, groups, and organization. Your Risk Score is calculated using risk factors from various <a href='#h_01HZMJ5DZ4RHSWJVBMH03HGEQE'>security types</a>, which are our groupings for risk factors. Risk factors include specific events that can be positive, such as reporting a phishing email with the Phish Alert Button (PAB), or negative, such as clicking a phishing link.</p>\n<p>Risk Scores increase when users fail phishing tests, engage in risky behaviors, or have their training completion statuses expire. Conversely, users can improve their scores by reporting phishing emails via the PAB and completing all assigned training modules.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Risk Scores update automatically based on tracked behaviors\u2014no manual adjustments are possible</li>\n<li>Organizational factors like missing security products can also influence scores</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more technical information about Risk Score and commonly asked questions and answers, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/40003728753171.html'>FAQ: SmartRisk Agent\u2122 and Risk Score Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Depending on your report type, you can filter your <strong>Risk Score Reports</strong> by <strong>Date Range</strong>, groups, managers, or users.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>Manager Risk Score</strong> report, you can use the <strong>Organization Chart</strong> to filter your report by user name or job title. This filter shows user data for all organization levels under the selected managers or job titles. For example, you can search for a specific job title, such as Director or Vice President. You can also select from the two options below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select<strong> Include All Team Members</strong> to include the direct and indirect reports of the selected managers in the report.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Include Selected Manager</strong> to include the selected manager in the report.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Reports/Reports/EN/RiskScorev2Reports/ManagerRiskScore.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Reports/Reports/EN/RiskScorev2Reports/ManagerRiskScore.png' alt=' '> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01HZMJ43D4KPFZFK9NN59TW8K5'>Available Range</h2>\n<p>Risk factors from security types inform your organization\u2019s available range.

Then, your organization\u2019s Risk Score will show the entirety of the user's performance, including all training completed and phishing test results from the past 90 days.

    "body": "<p>Usually, organizations have mailboxes that can be used to receive emails reported as phishing by users to be investigated. Defend will monitor the specified abuse mailbox to see what is being reported by end-users and automatically remediate malicious and persistent phishing threats. Event notifications can also be configured to notify admins when specific actions have occurred regarding the abuse mailbox, as well as provide a feedback loop to users, ensuring they understand they are helping keep your organization secure.</p>\n<p>Reported emails can be attached as EML files and sent to the abuse mailbox through a variety of methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emails reported using reporting buttons on the email summary page</li>\n<li>Phish alert buttons such as:\n<ul>\n<li>KnowBe4's Phish Alert Button (PAB)</li>\n<li>Microsoft's report phish button</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Emails forwarded as an attachment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expand the sections below to learn more:</p>\n<ul class='js-toggles' role='list'>\n<li title='Configuration'>\n<p>To configure the abuse mailbox, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Defend console.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Abuse Mailbox Automation</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter the address of your abuse mailbox.</li>\n<li>Use the <strong>Automatic Remediation</strong> drop-down menu to select whether emails classified as dangerous after reanalysis are all automatically remediated.</li>\n<li>Select which notifications are sent to users.

In the community, you can connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on new ideas with other admins, partners, and employees. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/15480944821395' target='_self'>KnowBe4 Community Guide</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you\u2019re brand new to KnowBe4, <span style='color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;'>this article will help you get started with setting up your KSAT console, a platform that provides security awareness training and simulated phishing</span>. Steps one and two are required, and steps three to five are optional but recommended.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2HNY6DFA2XFDHRM23KP0CK'>Step One: Whitelist Our Mail Servers</h2>\n<p>Before you start phishing and training your users, you\u2019ll need to whitelist our mail servers. Whitelisting will ensure our Phishing Security Tests (PSTs) and training notifications reach your users\u2019 inboxes. To learn more about whitelisting KnowBe4, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645138' target='_self'>Whitelisting Guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, contact <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/requests/new' target='_self'>our support team</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2HNY6DXT6DMEQCJMQ4YTK3'>Step Two: Add Your Users</h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to add your users' email addresses to your KSAT console to set up phishing and training campaigns. There are a few different options for importing your users' information into your console. You can use one of these three available methods to make user management an easy and automated process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Active Directory Integration (ADI): If you\u2019re using Active Directory, we recommend setting up ADI to maintain your user list automatically. Once ADI is set up, your KSAT console will automatically update user and group information based on data received from your Active Directory (AD). To learn more about setting up ADI, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/228373888'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide.</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM): KnowBe4's SCIM integration enables seamless user management in your KSAT console by using data from your SCIM identity provider (IdP). To learn more about configuring SCIM for your KnowBe4 console, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052380374-SCIM-Configuration-Guide#PROVIDERS'>SCIM Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Google User Provisioning (GUP): This integration enables automatic synchronization of user data between Google Workspace and your KnowBe4 console. If you\u2019d like to import users directly from your Google account into your KnowBe4 console, we recommend looking at our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/29586165576339-Google-User-Provisioning-GUP-Guide'>Google User Provisioning (GUP) Guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alternatively, you can add users manually or import them with a CSV file. For further information, see our<a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204873347-Import-Users-with-a-CSV-File'> Import Users with a CSV File</a>\u00a0article.</p>\n<p>You can choose how to group your users, such as grouping them by department or location. You can also target groups with phishing and training campaigns and allow groups to compete against each other on leaderboards.</p>\n<p>To learn more about adding your users, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204936887#ADDINGUSERS' target='_self'>Adding Users</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204936887' target='_self'>Users and Groups</a> guide.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2HNY6D78T4XNEWYRV5XF1X'>Step Three: Customize Your Account</h2>\n<p>You can customize your account and LX from your Account Settings. Here, you can add your organization\u2019s logo, set a theme color for your LX, and set your business days and hours. To learn more about customizing your account, view our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004742808' target='_self'>Add Your Company Logo, Logo URL, and Brand Color to Your Console</a> article.</p>\n<p>To learn more about setting up your business days and hours, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/227864388' target='_self'>Set Up Your Account\u2019s Time Zone, Business Days, and Hours</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2HNY6D2328RRP064BNZC0A'>Step Four: Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>\n<p>You can enable MFA to provide an extra layer of security and protect your organization's account information. This step is optional but recommended.</p>\n<p>To learn more about setting up MFA, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/225681448' target='_self'>Enable Two-Factor or Multi-Factor Authentication on My Account</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2HNY6EAEDBBS8NC3716HCY'>Step Five: Customize a Landing Page</h2>\n<p>Your users will see a default landing page if they fail your PSTs. You can customize this experience by adding your logo to one of our pre-made landing pages, or you can create your own landing page.</p>\n<p>After customizing or creating a landing page, you can set a default landing page in the <strong>Phishing</strong> section of your <strong>Account Settings</strong>. You\u2019ll also have the option to select a landing page <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204239938' target='_self'>when setting up a phishing campaign</a> or <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204240768#CREATINGCUSTOMEMAILS' target='_self'>editing email templates</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information about landing pages, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204240768' target='_self'>Create and Edit Email Templates and Landing Pages</a> or <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010417488' target='_self'>Best Practices: Choosing a Landing Page</a> article.</p>",

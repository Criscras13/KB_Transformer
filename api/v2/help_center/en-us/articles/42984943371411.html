  "body": "<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip: </strong>To access these settings, your organization must have deployed Prevent using the Deployment Center. If you do not see these options, please contact our support team for further assistance.</div>\n</div>\n<p>The <strong>Prevent Settings</strong> page is organized into two main tabs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General</li>\n<li>Policies</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01K04Y9HAVK0GJAQCMTFKM4BGF'>General Settings</h2>\n<p>The <strong>General Settings</strong> tab allows admins to manage the KnowBe4 Email Security Add-In and internal domains.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K04YB177C1NVH2BRRD5DRN2W'>KnowBe4 Email Security Add-In</h3>\n<p>The KnowBe4 Email Security Add-In card allows you to download the add-in manifest, ready for deployment to your organization. This is where you can also manage how the add-in delivers security and configure real-time nudge timeouts to balance email scanning speed with user productivity.</p>\n<h4 id='h_01K9SSV56MPSM2WH2ZHH5JVRF4'>Download Manifest</h4>\n<p>To download and install the KnowBe4 Email Security Add-In, select the <strong>Download Add-In Manifest</strong> button and follow the instructions provided in the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/40620880235155'>Web Add-In - Deployment Guide for Prevent</a> article.</p>\n<h4 id='h_01K9SSWDRZ03SGTZGE02BSG30M'>Real-Time Nudge Timeout\u00a0</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Real-time nudge timeout</strong> setting helps you strike the crucial balance between providing real-time security nudges and ensuring email delivery remains fast and smooth.</p>\n<p>This setting controls how long email sending pauses while the Email Security Add-In checks if a real-time nudge is needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the check completes within the set timeout, the user will get a real-time nudge before the email is sent, if necessary.</li>\n<li>If the check takes longer than the set timeout, the email will be held, and the gateway will scan it instead. Users will then receive an email nudge if the gateway detects a policy violation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend a timeout value of five seconds, which ensures most users receive real-time nudges without noticeably delaying email delivery.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that factors like attachments can impact the time it takes to complete a check. For instance, attachments add about two seconds to the email delivery time.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>Longer timeouts ensure nudges are delivered in real-time, but may delay email sending for emails with attachments. Most emails get a real-time nudge in under three seconds. For best results, set your timeout to five seconds.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01K04YEG45WQY5R2WDWXM4C5K8'>Internal Domain Management</h3>\n<p>Internal domain management helps Prevent accurately calculate email risk levels by distinguishing between internal and external recipients. This action is particularly important for detecting anomalies such as misdirected emails. Without a comprehensive list of internal domains, your organization's domains may be incorrectly classified as third parties.</p>\n<p>To add internal domains, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Prevent dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Prevent Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Internal Domain Management</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>+ Add Internal Domains</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the pop-up window, enter the domain to add to your organization's internal domains list.</li>\n<li>Confirm that the domain belongs to your organization.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Add Domain</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To remove an internal domain, follow the steps below:</p>\n<div class='callout-warning'>\n<div>\n<strong>Warning:</strong>Ensure you are not removing legitimate domains that your organization still uses.</div>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Prevent dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Prevent Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>General </strong>&gt; <strong>Internal Domain Management</strong>.</li>\n<li>Locate the domain you wish to remove.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Delete</strong> on the line containing the domain name.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Confirm </strong>in the confirmation pop-up window.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01K04YPDPBYW3NYJBKTQ96P878'>Policy Settings</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Policies</strong> section displays all available Prevent policies. Each policy card contains tablet icons showing their current mode:</p>\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>Monitoring mode</li>\n<li>Nudging mode</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To manage a policy\u2019s settings, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the <strong>Manage Policy</strong> button on the policy you wish to update.</li>\n<li>Review the policy overview and the triggers that initiate user nudges.</li>\n<li>Choose the appropriate operation mode:\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Monitor &amp; Nudge</strong>: Actively nudges users when policy violations occur</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Monitor</strong>: Tracks violations without alerting users</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Save</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Save Changes</strong> in the pop-up window to confirm your changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The Blocklist policy cannot be deactivated.

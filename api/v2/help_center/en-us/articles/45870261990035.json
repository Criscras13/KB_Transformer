Our fair usage policies differ by product and feature, so refer to each section below for more information on the functionality guidelines and conditions for each product.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If a feature or subscription service isn\u2019t listed below or in our <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/Legal'>Terms of Service</a>, there are no usage limits.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01K892NREXRDVAJP0CCJ21B41X'>HRM+ Platform Fair Usage Policies</h2>\n<p>See the sections below for more information on fair usage policies for the HRM+ platform.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K88XQ8QZ2TWZ3Y8GK70QJTQS'>Uploaded Content</h3>\n<p>You can add up to 200 custom courses to your account. If your account exceeds this limit, a banner will display on your console. Each course can contain as many language files as your organization needs. See the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360019644394.html'>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360019644394.html'>Upload Custom Training Content</a> article for more information.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K88XS1ZVN7JKW8960T3VJNX9'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Sync Frequency</h3>\n<p>Our ADI feature includes a <strong>Test Mode</strong> setting to help you configure and verify your user provisioning settings before performing a live sync. The sync frequency depends on whether <strong>Test Mode</strong> is enabled for your account.</p>\n<p>While <strong>Test Mode</strong> is enabled, you can start and stop the ADI service as frequently as you would like. This setting allows for flexible testing and configuration.</p>\n<p>Once <strong>Test Mode</strong> is disabled, your ADI sync request frequency is limited to once every six hours. If you request a sync during this six-hour window, the new sync will fail to start. The sync attempt won\u2019t appear in the <strong>Users</strong> &gt; <strong>Provisioning</strong> subtab, but the exact error details will be available in your log files.</p>\n<p>See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228466847.html'>FAQ: Active Directory Integration (ADI)</a> article for more information.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K88XWSCR3G1JJ6Z5QHEHASHV'>KnowBe4\u2019s System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) Sync Frequency</h3>\n<p>KnowBe4 has a 15-minute global sync limit to avoid overloading the service queue. If a sync has occurred in the last 15 minutes, any new request will be skipped. See the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360052380374.html'>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360052380374.html'>SCIM Configuration Guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K88XYYMV9724VRDEG2GGH9JD'>REST-Based Reporting API</h3>\n<p>For our REST-Based Reporting APIs, there are daily request limits and burst request limits. These limits are a standard practice for enterprise API applications and are in place to manage server resources effectively. By having limits, we prevent system overload and ensure stable, reliable performance for all our customers.</p>\n<h4 id='h_01K88XZDN72RV1V5Y24CRTWFEZ'>Daily Reporting API Request Limits</h4>\n<p>Daily reporting requests are limited to 2000 requests plus the number of licensed users per day, with a limit of four requests per second. This limit affects all customers.</p>\n<p>The API daily limit will reset around 24 hours from the first API request.</p>\n<h4 id='h_01K88Y03WQYJVQ4MD5VQ93Z3A8'>Burst Reporting API Request Limits</h4>\n<p>For more frequent, smaller requests, reporting requests are limited to a maximum of 50 requests per minute. This limit affects all customers.</p>\n<p>If a user exceeds 50 requests per minute, a rate limit will be imposed for five minutes. This timer resets five minutes after the first request.</p>\n<h4 id='h_01K88Y0Z50622VZGJPNR2HPG8R'>Practical Implications and Error Handling</h4>\n<p>To ensure successful data retrieval, we recommend building these API limits into any automated reporting or data integration workflows. All automated tools should be designed to use short bursts of requests rather than sustained, high-volume pulls.</p>\n<p>If your reporting requests exceed these limits, the REST API will return an error response, and the request won\u2019t be processed. Your workflows should include logic to handle these error responses.</p>\n<p>For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115016090908.html'>Reporting API Overview</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K88Y3WG9199AYG3V2NFY0PRT'>User Event API Limits</h3>\n<p>User Event API calls can be used to add custom events to a user's timeline or to pull existing event data for a user.</p>\n<p>If your reporting requests exceed these limits, the REST API will return an error response, and the request won\u2019t be processed. Your workflows should include logic to handle these error responses.</p>\n<p>For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115016090908.html'>Reporting API Overview</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K88Y5EWS5QA689VQ53HG24GB'>SecurityCoach Integration Connections</h3>\n<p>For optimal performance with SecurityCoach, we recommend limiting your account to a maximum of three external vendor connections.</p>\n<p>To maintain system stability and a high-quality experience for all customers, we reserve the right to review or disconnect an integration if excessive usage is detected. This right includes scenarios where an account generates over 100,000 events per day or causes adverse system performance that impacts other customers.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01K88YBY0A4CYK6J3VDDBVYVXR'>Graph API Usage</h2>\n<p>Our Graph API is designed for your internal use to manage your account programmatically. You can use it to create training and phishing campaigns, create and delete users, pull campaign and user data, and more.</p>\n<p>To ensure stable performance and fair resource allocation for all customers, we have soft limits in place for Graph API usage. These limits are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10 requests per licensed user on your account per day</li>\n<li>Four requests per second</li>\n<li>Query complexity limitation of 150</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4404258222099.html'>KnowBe4 Graph API Overview</a> article.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The query complexity limit doesn\u2019t apply to the PhishER Graph API.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01K88Y8HM7M02Z1H59MP5WKF6H'>Protect</h2>\n<p>To ensure service stability, limits are in place for the number of emails that can be encrypted.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K88YD52P649Q3PDXAMP09VSA'>Encryption Key Limits</h3>\n<p>The number of encryption keys that can be generated is limited to 25,000 per licensed user within 24 hours. If this limit is reached, any additional emails sent during those 24 hours will be delivered but won\u2019t be encrypted.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K88YF0C93VZHHFA7NMT727AT'>Web Access Sending Limits</h3>\n<p>For emails sent directly from our <strong>Web Access</strong> portal, the sending limits are based on a 24-hour timeline and differ for free and paid users.</p>\n<p>Free users can send up to 10 encrypted emails. If a free user receives and opens an encrypted email sent by a paid user, their sending limit for that 24-hour period will increase to 50 encrypted emails.</p>\n<p>Paid users can send up to 200 encrypted emails.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01K88YFB6S08A34DZZXHVAZY2C'>Fair Usage Notification Process</h2>\n<p>Our goal is to work with you to ensure your account operates within these guidelines. If an account review is required due to usage exceeding the limits in this policy, we\u2019ll follow a clear communication process as outlined below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>KSAT: If an account review is necessary, your Customer Success Manager will notify you by email before any action is taken.</li>\n<li>SecurityCoach: If an integration requires review, you\u2019ll be notified through the critical alert system in your console.

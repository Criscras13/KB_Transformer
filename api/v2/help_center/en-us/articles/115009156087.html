  "body": "<p>In your KSAT console, you can enable the password-less logins feature in your <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/226457887'>Account Settings</a> to allow users to log in to their assigned training directly without requiring them to use a password. You can also use our specially designed training notifications to let your users access training through this password-less method.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong> Password-less logins are convenient and easy to use, but this feature isn't the most secure. If a login link is shared or leaked to the internet, it could be indexed by Google or other search engines. This indexing means that attackers could view the URL and related information, such as a user\u2019s email address, well after the link has expired. To learn how to use password-less logins safely, see the <a href='#h_01GSDCFRSQ81HJ47A2FY7QP7HX' target='_self'>Best Practices for Password-Less Logins</a> section of this article.</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you need further assistance with password-less logins, contact our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/requests/new'>support team</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HQNMRJEYPTP4M7YH673X25FH'>What Are Password-Less Logins?</h2>\n<p>By default, your users will be prompted to set a password for their training account once they confirm their account and log in for the first time. Alternatively, you can set a password for your users once they are imported into the console.</p>\n<p>If password-less logins are enabled instead, users will receive an email with a customized link. Users can click this link to access their Learner Experience (LX) or take their training directly. They can use this link to log in without creating or entering a password at any time.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>Clicking the link will take users directly to their <strong>My Training</strong> page, even if they\u2019ve used a password for their LX in the past.</div>\n</div>\n<p>This link provides users the convenience of not having to remember a password for their training account.</p>\n<p>For board members or other employees who need to take training but cannot receive the password-less login links, you can send them to <a href='https://training.knowbe4.com/users/login/' target='_self'>https://training.knowbe4.com/users/login/</a> to log in with their assigned email address and password that you set for them. Alternatively, you can manually generate a link for them by following the steps in the <a href='#h_01GSDDFE080Q0TNF5XHVYV9CD9' target='_self'>Generating New Password-Less Login Links</a> section of this article. For more information about training users outside your organization's domain, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/235675668-How-Do-I-Assign-Board-Members-Training-'>Train External Users</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HQNMRJEY5Z37DY57Z3ZH0A7S'>Set Up Password-Less Logins\u00a0</h2>\n<p>To set up password-less logins, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT console and click your email address in the top-right corner.

If both SSO and password-less logins are enabled, users with access to KnowBe4 through SSO will log in through their SSO portal and authenticate with their identity provider. Users who don't have SSO accounts will have to wait for their password-less login notification to log in.</p>\n<p>As a final best practice after enabling password-less logins, you should be especially aware of what training notifications you're using. We offer built-in templates with the <strong>password-less</strong> tag containing the password-less login placeholder, which will automatically populate your training notification. Alternatively, you can create your own templates that include our password-less placeholders. For more information about placeholders read the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204949707-How-To-Use-Placeholders' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Placeholders Guide</a>.</p>",

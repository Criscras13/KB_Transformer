You can write <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360013025854.html' target='_self'>custom rules</a> using YARA logic. For general information about creating rules in PhishER, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360013025854.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage PhishER Rules</a> article. To help you get started with YARA rules, see our list of common use cases and rules in our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360019622314.html'>Use Cases for YARA Rules</a> article.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>PhishER currently supports version 4.1.2 of YARA. For more information, see YARA's <a href='https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v4.1.2/writingrules.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Writing YARA rules</a> documentation.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HAQP30SBK6BTM343148WV7AN'>Using YARA Logic</h2>\n<p>A YARA rule is a logical expression with a description based on textual or binary patterns. A rule begins with a <strong>rule identifier</strong>, and a rule\u2019s description contains three sections: the meta, the strings, and the condition. These sections determine how a rule works.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>Use ASCII characters to write custom rules in PhishER. You cannot create a PhishER rule that contains non-ASCII characters. To learn more about ASCII characters, visit this <a href='https://www.ascii-code.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>ASCII web page</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HAQP30SBDHTCRMNHDG3V3X1C'>Rule Identifier</h2>\n<p>Start every YARA rule using the keyword <strong>rule</strong> followed by an <strong>identifier</strong>. An identifier is a unique name for your rule. Rule identifiers are case sensitive, cannot include spaces or start with a numerical value, and cannot include any of the keywords listed in YARA's <a href='https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v4.1.2/writingrules.html#id3' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Writing YARA Rules</a> documentation.</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/Documentation/YARARules/ruleIdentifier.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/Documentation/YARARules/ruleIdentifier.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<h2 id='h_01HAQP30SB1NHQ6W4DEQMFYGWB'>Meta</h2>\n<p>Next, you can include a <strong>meta</strong> section to add comments or details about your rule. If you have multiple admins writing or editing YARA rules in PhishER, it can be helpful to use the <strong>meta</strong> section as an internal change log.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The information provided in the meta section is not used for any variation of malware detection.</div>\n</div>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/Documentation/YARARules/meta.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/Documentation/YARARules/meta.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<h2 id='h_01HAQP30SB0NQD5P6DPTV69JXX'>Strings</h2>\n<p>In the <strong>strings</strong> section, declare a variable and set its value. Each variable is indicated by the <strong>$</strong> sign followed by the variable name. Variables are case sensitive and cannot include spaces or start with a numerical value.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If you\u2019re using a global variable in your rule, enter the value of the global variable in double brackets. You should enter the value as it is displayed in the rules list under <strong>Rules</strong> &gt; <strong>Global Variables</strong> in your PhishER platform.

    "body": "<p>On the <strong>Library</strong> tab of the Learner Experience (LX), your users can view their<strong> Optional Learning</strong> content. Providing optional learning encourages users to choose training content that interests them and can help you create a stronger security awareness culture.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Library</strong> tab is hidden from your users until you enable one of the optional learning features in your <strong>Account Settings</strong>. There are two optional learning features: <strong>AI-recommended learning</strong>, available to Diamond accounts, and <strong>Optional Training Campaigns</strong>, available to all paid accounts. Diamond accounts can use both features together if desired.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HKZ4CPTHKG75HXPW47FKAP61'>AI-recommended Learning</h2>\n<p>Available to Diamond accounts, <strong>AI-recommended learning</strong>\u00a0allows you to provide relevant training content for your users without creating an optional training campaign.

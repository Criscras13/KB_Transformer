    "body": "<p>In your PhishER console, rules are logical expressions that allow you to automatically disposition and tag messages in your PhishER Inbox. The assigned tags trigger PhishER to run actions on the messages. You can create rules from the <strong>Rules</strong> tab. If you would like to create an action, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/13195730767635.html'>How to Create and Manage PhishER Actions</a> article.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Rules</strong> tab contains two types of rules: custom rules and system rules. Custom rules are rules that you can create by using the Yara Rule Editor. System rules are default rules provided by KnowBe4. The <strong>Rules</strong> tab also contains global variables, which are variables that you create to use in multiple rules with the same strings. By updating a global variable, you can update all of the rules that contain those strings.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>All PhishER rules must follow Yet Another Recursive/Ridiculous Acronym (YARA) rule logic to disposition messages. To learn more about writing YARA rules, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360013116053.html'>How to Write YARA Rules</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HJS7MXG7W45D60YF5G2N3W5T'>Creating Rules</h2>\n<p>You can create custom rules in your PhishER console to disposition messages that have been forwarded to your PhishER Inbox. To create your rules, you can use either the Basic Editor or the Advanced Editor. All custom rules must follow Yet Another Recursive/Ridiculous Acronym (<a href='https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>YARA</a>) logic. YARA is a tool used to identify and classify malware samples.</p>\n<p>To create a rule, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your PhishER console.</li>\n<li>From the sidebar on the left side of the page, select the <strong>Rules</strong> tab to open the <strong>Rules List</strong> page.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>New Rule</strong> button at the top-right corner of the page to open the <strong>Rule Details</strong> page.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If you want PhishER to automatically generate a rule based on a description of your needs, see the <a href='#h_01K7HEZY81WE0931JEXR54QBDJ'>Creating Rules Using the YARA Rule Generator</a> section.</div>\n</div>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/Documentation/RulesandActions/RuleDetails_Name.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/Documentation/RulesandActions/RuleDetails_Name.png' alt=' ' width='629' height='294'></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> field, enter a unique name for your rule. We recommend that you enter a name that briefly describes the function of the rule. The name cannot start with a numerical value, exceed 64 characters, or include any of the keywords listed in YARA's <a href='https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v4.1.2/writingrules.html#id3' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Writing YARA Rules</a> documentation.</li>\n<li>(Optional) In the <strong>Description</strong> field, enter a description of your rule. As a best practice, we recommend that you enter a description of the rule's intended function. The description cannot exceed 64 characters.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Edit Tags:</strong> section, add a custom tag that you would like to see attached to a message if the message matches this specific rule. To add a tag, click Add new tag and enter a name for your tag. Then, click outside of the Add new tag field to create the tag.</li>\n<li>From the <strong>Choose target:</strong> drop-down menu, select the part of the message you would like the rule to be applied to or run on. The targets you can select are Raw, Headers, Body, or Attachments. By default, Raw will be selected.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Yara Rule Editor</strong> section, write your rule using either the Basic Editor or the Advanced Editor. For more information, see the subsections below.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01HJS7MXG77M82295Q0T61VYBA'>Creating Rules Using the Basic Editor</h3>\n<p>The Basic Editor allows you to create a custom rule without writing all of the YARA rule logic. You can enter values for strings and select conditions for your rule, and the Basic Editor will process your input to create the rule logic for your rule.

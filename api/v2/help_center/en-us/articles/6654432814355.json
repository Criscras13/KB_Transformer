    "body": "<p>SecurityCoach is an add-on product for the KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training (KSAT) console that is available for our Platinum-level and Diamond-level customers to purchase. SecurityCoach can be used to coach your users about their behavior in real time using SecurityTips. You can customize your coaching experience by integrating your vendors, reviewing your detection rules, setting up real-time coaching campaigns, and choosing specific SecurityTip media and notifications to send to your users.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>You can use SecurityTips to warn users about their risky behaviors or to reward users for practicing good security behaviors. For example, if a user successfully reports a simulated phishing test, you can send a SecurityTip to congratulate them for spotting the phishing signs.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Before you can begin monitoring user behavior and coaching your users in real time, you will need to set up SecurityCoach in your KSAT console. To set up SecurityCoach, you must configure your vendor integrations, set up a delivery method for your SecurityTips, review your rule detections, and create a real-time coaching campaign.</p>\n<p>To learn more about setting up SecurityCoach, see the subsections below.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>To view a SecurityCoach product demo, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000937648.html'>KnowBe4 Product Demos</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PTY6EJJTCSDBD16BZ2'>Configuring Security Vendor Integrations</h2>\n<p>First, you'll need to set up your third-party vendor integrations in the <strong>SecurityCoach </strong>&gt; <strong>Setup</strong> tab of your KSAT console. Once you set up a vendor integration, the vendor's data will be available in SecurityCoach. You can use this data to begin monitoring user behaviors.</p>\n<p>For more information about setting up vendor integrations in SecurityCoach, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/sections/10969917980435'>Setting Up Integrations</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PT214EVB87E4WSKH2M'>Adding a Delivery Method</h2>\n<p>Email is pre-configured as the default delivery method for SecurityCoach. If you coach your users via email, SecurityTips will be sent to their user email address that is set in the <strong>Users</strong> tab of your KSAT console.</p>\n<p><br>SecurityCoach also supports integrations with Google Chat, Microsoft Teams, and Slack. If your organization uses any of these platforms for communication, we recommend configuring one as your primary delivery method, so you can coach your users where they communicate most often.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>If Google Chat, Microsoft Teams, or Slack are set as the primary delivery method, email can be used as a backup delivery method.</div>\n</div>\n<p>For more information on setting up delivery methods, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/sections/20416205509011-Configuring-Delivery-Methods'>Configuring Delivery Methods</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PT5HHCX6F30SFH3W05'>Mapping Users</h2>\n<p>Mapping your users to identifiers, such as a hostname, helps link user behavior to specific users. User mapping is done automatically for email and web security vendors using the user email addresses set in the <strong>Users</strong> tab of your KSAT console. You may also need to map additional identifiers for your endpoint security vendors. For example, you may need to map users to their hostnames, usernames, or device IDs.</p>\n<p>You can configure mapping rules to automatically map users for you, manually map users by uploading a CSV file, or use a combination of both methods. SecurityCoach also provides mapping recommendations for you to review.</p>\n<p>For more information about mapping users, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/7156417916307.html'>Map Users in SecurityCoach</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PTHPMWP7FNS5T810AG'>Reviewing Rule Detections</h2>\n<p>SecurityCoach provides system detection rules for each security vendor. Detection rules identify which user behaviors you would like to track using the data provided by your integrated vendors. When you integrate a vendor, these detection rules are enabled automatically, but you can also create custom detection rules for your organization's needs.</p>\n<p>We recommend reviewing your top detection rules and prioritizing the user behaviors you want to target with your real-time coaching campaigns. To review your top detection rules, navigate to the <strong>Reports</strong> subtab of SecurityCoach and click <strong>Report</strong> for the <strong>Detection Rules Report</strong>. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/7159155080851.html'>SecurityCoach Reporting Overview</a> article.</p>\n<p>To view all your detection rules, navigate to <strong>SecurityCoach</strong> &gt; <strong>Detection Rules</strong>. For more information about detection rules, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/7159083016723.html'>Detection Rules Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HZPZAHGZ24V6S6Y9SNRZHCWX'>Creating a Test Mode Campaign</h2>\n<p>To test how your real-time coaching campaigns will perform before you begin coaching your users, you can use our <strong>Test Mode</strong> feature to create a test mode campaign. In a test mode campaign, SecurityCoach detects user behaviors but does not send coaching to your users. You can turn your test mode campaign into a <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/7159255924371.html'>real-time coaching campaign</a> at any time. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/30053728045459.html'>Working with Test Mode Campaigns</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PTTYHKTB4PC9FVQCMF'>Creating a Real-Time Coaching Campaign</h2>\n<p>Finally, we recommend creating a real-time coaching campaign. Real-time coaching campaigns send SecurityTips to users when user behaviors are detected. SecurityTips can be sent through Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, or email.</p>\n<p>To create a real-time coaching campaign, navigate to the <strong>Real-Time Coaching</strong> subtab of SecurityCoach. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/7159255924371.html'>Real-Time Coaching Campaigns Guide</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9QWK8PT1AHNPFDR6H6TRW9E'>SecurityCoach Workflow</h2>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/security_coach/securitycoach_workflow.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/security_coach/securitycoach_workflow.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>The SecurityCoach workflow involves both SecurityCoach and the vendors that you have integrated. For more information, see the workflow list below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your integrated vendors monitor user behaviors using email, endpoint, and browser events.</li>\n<li>The vendors share those events with SecurityCoach.</li>\n<li>SecurityCoach processes this information and determines whether the vendor events match the criteria for any of your detection rules.</li>\n<li>If an event matches a detection rule\u2019s criteria, the detection rule is triggered, and the event is added to the responsible user\u2019s events timeline.</li>\n<li>If the detection rule is part of a real-time coaching campaign, the user will also receive a SecurityTip to coach their behavior.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>SecurityCoach events can also influence your users\u2019 and organization's Risk Score.

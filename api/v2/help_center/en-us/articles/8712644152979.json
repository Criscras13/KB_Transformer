    "body": "<p>In this article, you will learn how to integrate Cisco Umbrella with SecurityCoach. Once you set up this integration, data provided by Cisco Umbrella will be available under the <strong>SecurityCoach</strong> tab of your KSAT console. This data can be viewed in SecurityCoach reports and used to create detection rules for real-time coaching campaigns. For general information about SecurityCoach, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/6654432814355'>SecurityCoach Product Manual</a>.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>SecurityCoach also supports integrating Cisco Umbrella as a Splunk vendor.

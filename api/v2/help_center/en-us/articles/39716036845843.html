Group mailboxes are set up the same way as normal users, except for the admin, who should specify the password upon creation to ensure that this is documented in case group mailbox users attempt to reset the account.</p>\n<p>Once the account has been activated, an admin should follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign in to the <a href='https://switch.egress.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Administration Panel</a> and navigate to <strong>User Management</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the group mailbox and navigate to the <strong>Authentication</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Unselect the option <strong>Allow user to reset password via self-help</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Following these steps ensures the password reset can only be managed by admins or service desk users, which will avoid having the account reset by multiple users when forgotten.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JR8RT4MCWJ8FWRQDMXT5CGYP'>Using a Group Mailbox</h2>\n<p>To send securely from a group mailbox, the user should sign in with the group mailbox credentials, and send the group email through Microsoft Outlook as normal.</p>\n<p>Once sent, the user should then sign out and sign back in with their personal credentials.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JR8RT4MC1TY58K8CDJ2F097C'>Managing a Group Mailbox Packages</h2>\n<p>Should a secure email from a group mailbox need to be revoked because it was sent to the wrong person or an access request needs to be approved, the user can sign into the client or the <a href='https://switch.egress.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Administration Panel</a> with the mailbox credentials and navigate to <strong>Sent Packages</strong> to complete the necessary actions.</p>\n<p>An admin can also have full visibility over these group mailbox packages by selecting the account from <strong>User Management</strong> and clicking the yellow package icon next to the account. The admin can then manage that specific user\u2019s packages.</p>",

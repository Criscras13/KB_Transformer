    "body": "<p>In KCM GRC, you can create tasks for controls to help you manage your ongoing compliance and risk management efforts. As a best practice, we recommend that you create recurring tasks for your controls, but you can also create one-time tasks for your controls. Then, you can assign tasks to users in your organization so the users can submit evidence for your controls.</p>\n<p>See the sections below to learn how to create and work with tasks.\u00a0<a name='PREREQUISITES'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J6W871Y523058RVPXFHXADBR'>Prerequisites for Creating Tasks</h2>\n<p>Before you create tasks for your controls, you will need to complete the actions listed below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Either create controls for our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115016129608.html' target='_self'>scoped requirements</a> or <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4405907699987.html' target='_self'>risks</a>, or map existing controls to your scoped requirements or risks. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360049579594.html' target='_self'>How to Create Controls from Scoped Requirements</a> and <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360060605553.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Map Risk Controls</a> articles.</li>\n<li>Create user accounts for the individuals in your organization who will be responsible for completing or approving control tasks. When you create user accounts, you can assign user roles to the user accounts based on the responsibilities you would like to give to each user. For example, if a user will only be responsible for completing tasks, you would assign the Contributor user role to that user.

For example, if you select the <strong>Monthly</strong> frequency and set a start date of July 7, 2022, the task will be open from July 7, 2022 until August 7, 2022, and the next task will also begin on August 7, 2022. In this example, the User Assigned should submit evidence between July 7, 2022 and August 7, 2022. For more information about the task frequency, see the <a href='#EDR_FREQUENCY' target='_self'>EDR Task Frequencies</a> section below.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Start Date: </strong>From the calendar, select the date that the task will start. Together, the task's <strong>Start Date</strong> and <strong>Task Frequency</strong> will determine the end date for the task. If you select a frequency other than <strong>One Time</strong>, the first task's end date will be the start date for the next task.

    "body": "<p>You can assign a Security Culture Survey (SCS) organizational assessment to your users to assess your organization's security culture. Security culture is defined as the ideas, customs, and social behaviors that impact your organization\u2019s security.</p>\n<p>Your survey results will provide you with an overview of the seven dimensions that make up your security culture and an overall security culture score for your organization. You can use this information to establish a baseline for your security culture, to determine the changes you need to make to your security protocols, and to measure how your security culture evolves over time.</p>\n<p>To develop the questions in this survey, we used a scientific research approach. For more information about how these questions were created and why we use the seven dimensions, see our <a href='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/assessments/KB4_SecurityCultureSurvey.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>KnowBe4 Security Culture Survey</a> technical document.</p>\n<p>In this article, you'll learn how to use the SCS and how to review your organization\u2019s survey results. For more information about how to use organizational assessments effectively, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360024195754.html'>How to Use Organizational Assessments</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1TK8JQF5ZAD3A1PGWXP4CH'>Best Practices</h2>\n<p>We recommend that you assign the Security Culture Survey to your users after their first 90 days of employment. We recommend that you wait at least 90 days to ensure that your users have adjusted to your organization's security culture. After the first survey, you should continue to assess your users once per year. If you assess your users once per year, you will be able to see how your organization's security culture changes over time.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1TK8JQWRQRVEE68825ZB77'>Assigning Organizational Assessments</h2>\n<p>To assign an organizational assessment, add the assessment through the ModStore by searching for assessments and clicking the <strong>+ Add to Library</strong> button. Then, you can create a training campaign with the assessment as the selected content by following the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your KnowBe4 console and navigate to <strong>Training</strong> &gt; <strong>Campaigns</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>+ Create Training Campaign</strong>.</li>\n<li>From the <strong>Content</strong> drop-down menu, select the assessment you'd like to assign.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/assessments/add_assessment.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/assessments/add_assessment.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Fill out all required fields for the campaign. For more information on how to create a new campaign, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204948207.html'>Creating and Managing Training Campaigns</a> article.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Create Campaign</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1TK8JQTN26YW3MSP1KW187'>Completing the Security Culture Survey in the Learner Experience</h2>\n<p>To complete the Security Culture Survey, your users will log in to their Learner Experience (LX) and click the <strong>Training</strong> tab. Then, they'll locate the Security Culture Survey and click <strong>Start</strong>.</p>\n<p>After they click Start, your users have the option to either start the survey or complete the survey later. If the user clicks <strong>Take Survey Now</strong>, they must answer all 32 questions to complete the survey. If the user does not have time to take the survey immediately, we recommend they click <strong>Come Back Later</strong> when they have time to take the full survey.</p>\n<p>After your users complete the survey, they will be directed to a thank-you page.</p>\n<p>On this thank you page, your users will also have the opportunity to submit anonymous feedback. This feedback can be downloaded from the <strong>Assessment Results</strong> tab of the campaign. For more information about downloading user feedback, see the <a href='#h_01HS1TK8JRMDDRVGV4P4R2HX2R'>Survey Culture Survey Results</a> section below.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1TK8JRCEY9D6S6XVDG3G96'>Monitoring Your Security Culture Survey Campaign</h2>\n<p>After you assign the Security Culture Survey to your users, you can view your users' progress.

Specifically, the survey responses were updated to be more semantically appropriate, timely, and improved for content validity.</p>\n<p>For this version of the Security Culture Survey, we ensured that each assessment a user receives includes three to six questions per individual dimension, each covering a different aspect of a particular dimension. We evaluated the quality of our items following a rigorous scientific method, using customer data from various industries and cultures worldwide.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Security Culture Survey update, please see our <a href='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/assessments/KB4_SecurityCultureSurvey2.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Security Culture Survey (SCS) Version 2</a> technical document.</p>",

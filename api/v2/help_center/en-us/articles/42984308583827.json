    "body": "<p>Prevent requires users to be added to specific Microsoft user groups to enable both the analysis of email behavior patterns and the delivery of security nudges. This article explains the importance of these groups and provides step-by-step instructions for adding users to them.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01K04X18GPKQWBAGAGRW6NPQQE'>Provisioning Group</h2>\n<p>During the deployment process of Prevent, you will be asked to add your users to the Prevent Provisioning group. This critical step enables the system to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sync your users with the Prevent system</li>\n<li>Begin analyzing their historical email behavior</li>\n<li>Create a baseline understanding of communication patterns and relationships</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend adding all of your organization's users to this group to ensure Prevent has comprehensive data to work with. This step will maximize Prevent's effectiveness.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01K04X3MYTRCFGYBGAEHWDZA2T'>Nudge Group</h2>\n<p>Once you're ready to deploy Prevent's nudging functionality, users must be added to the Nudge group in Microsoft. Users in this group will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start receiving Prevent real-time nudges via the web add-in</li>\n<li>Receive retrospective email nudges when applicable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to roll out Prevent nudging to all of your organization's users, add them to this group. You can also choose to add users gradually if you prefer a phased deployment approach.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01K04X59NZHM6T0245S8K5K0X2'>Propagation</h2>\n<p>Please be aware that due to Microsoft's system limitations, changes made to groups will not take effect immediately. Adding new users to groups typically takes between one and 24 hours to update. The KnowBe4 Email Security web add-in can take between 24 and 48 hours to propagate to users.</p>\n<p>These delays mean newly added users won't immediately see Prevent nudges after being added to the relevant groups.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01K04X6GVWM0DCEM8XAHA769F1'>Adding Users to Microsoft Groups</h2>\n<p>To add users to the provisioning or nudge group in Microsoft, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Teams &amp; groups</strong> &gt; <strong>Active teams &amp; groups</strong>.</li>\n<li>Locate and select the provisioning or nudge group.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Membership </strong>and then <strong>Members</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Add members</strong>.</li>\n<li>Search for and select the users you wish to add.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Add </strong>to confirm your selections.</li>\n</ol>",

If you're not an MSP or Reseller, please visit our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/225681448'>How Do I Enable Two-Factor or Multi-Factor Authentication on My Account?</a> article to enable authentication for standard accounts.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) or two-factor authentication (2FA) on your MSP or Reseller account will require an additional identity verification step at the time you log in. Once configured and enabled for an account, our system will require the use of an authentication code generated by an authenticator application each time you log in to your account. Reseller account owners and admins can set this up for themselves. As an alternative, reseller account owners may set this up for each reseller admin. Admins can also enable MFA for admins or all users. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/12731036715411-KnowBe4-Console-Account-Settings-User-Management'>KSAT Account Settings: User Management</a> article.</p>\n<div class='callout-info'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>This feature is not applicable if you are using a single sign-on (SSO) login method.

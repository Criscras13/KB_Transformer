    "body": "<p>Available to Diamond-level subscriptions, KnowBe4's PasswordIQ allows you to monitor your users' password vulnerabilities. The PasswordIQ client scans for vulnerabilities in your Active Directory (AD)'s password-related settings and compares your users' passwords to breached and weak passwords from various lists and databases. Then, the client communicates with KSAT to display your scan results on your dashboard.</p>\n<p>To enable PasswordIQ, navigate to <strong>Account Integrations</strong> &gt; <strong>PasswordIQ</strong> in your <strong>Account Settings</strong>. Then, select the <strong>Enable PasswordIQ</strong> check box.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>To use PasswordIQ, you'll need the on-premises version of AD. PasswordIQ is incompatible with Microsoft Entra ID.</div>\n</div>\n<p>See the sections below to learn how to install the client, run scans, and view your results.</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong>PasswordIQ will never display or report your users' passwords. In AD, all passwords are encrypted and stored in a hashed format, so the unhashed versions of passwords are inaccessible to PasswordIQ and KnowBe4.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HA0HJ1N04P6X0XA86735V492'>Requirements</h2>\n<p>To install the PasswordIQ client, you'll need to meet the requirements listed below:</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong> We recommend that you install the client on a different computer than the computer you use as your domain controller. The scan process may generate high network traffic and computer processing unit (CPU) usage. For best results, install the client on a virtual machine or server that can run continuously.</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>You have access to a computer that meets the requirements:\n<ul>\n<li>The computer's operating system is Windows 10 or later with 32-bit or 64-bit, or Windows Server 2016 or later.</li>\n<li>The computer uses a version of .NET Framework with 4.7.2 or later.<br>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> If your computer doesn\u2019t have this framework, the Setup Wizard will install version 4.7.2 for you</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The computer has at least four GB of RAM.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The computer's system drive has at least one GB of available hard disk drive (HDD) space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User Account Control (UAC) is enabled in the computer's UAC settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You have access to an on-premises AD that runs on Windows Server 2008 R2 or a later version.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> If you have multiple AD domains, you'll need to install a different instance of the client for each domain.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>You have access to an AD domain administrator or an AD account that can be elevated as an administrator. This account must have <strong>Replicating Directory Changes</strong> and <strong>Replicating Directory Changes All</strong> permissions. For more information, see Microsoft's<a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/grant-replicating-directory-changes-permission-adma-service' target='_blank' rel='noopener'> Replicating Directory Changes permission</a> article.</li>\n<li>You're a KSAT admin or have a security role with <strong>Read</strong>/<strong>Write</strong> access to PasswordIQ.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01HA0HJ1N0B73QBHSJVCG4SWDT'>Vulnerabilities</h2>\n<p>The PasswordIQ client scans each user for 11 vulnerabilities and reports the vulnerabilities that it finds to KSAT. Additionally, our Risk Score Report uses these vulnerabilities as risk factors when calculating your Risk Score. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/30048977242259.html'>Smart Risk Agent\u2122 and Risk Score Guide</a></p>\n<p>For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the table below:</p>\n<table style='table-layout: auto;'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Vulnerability</th>\n<th scope='col'>Description</th>\n<th scope='col'>Risk Score Severity Level</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weak Password</td>\n<td>The password matches a password from one of our weak password lists, so it's common or easy to guess. A cybercriminal may be more likely to guess the password and access the user's account.</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shared Password</td>\n<td>The password matches at least one other user's password in your AD. The password is likely common or simple, so a cybercriminal may be more likely to access the user's account.</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clear Text Password</td>\n<td>The password is stored with reversible encryption in your AD. The password can be decrypted, so a cybercriminal may be more likely to access the user's account.</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Empty Password</td>\n<td>The password doesn't contain any characters, so the user logs in to the account by leaving the password field blank. Anyone can access the user's account, including cybercriminals.</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DES-Only Encryption</td>\n<td>The account uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) to encrypt the user's password. DES is an outdated encryption method because it encrypts the password with only a 56-bit key, while newer encryption methods use longer keys that are more secure. A cybercriminal may be more likely to guess the password and access the user's account.</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breached Password</td>\n<td>The password was exposed in a data breach that is connected to your AD account. The user is actively using a password that is accessible to cybercriminals.</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Password Not Required</td>\n<td>The account doesn't require a user to enter a password when they log in. Anyone can log in to the account, including cybercriminals.</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Password Never Expires</td>\n<td>The account has its password timeout set to zero. Because of this setting, even if the <strong>Password never expires</strong> check box in the user\u2019s properties is unchecked, their password will never expire. PasswordIQ will check password expiration settings in your organization\u2019s domain policies, fine-grained password policies, and user properties. Passwords that aren\u2019t changed often have a higher chance of being guessed by cybercriminals.</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LM-Hash Password</td>\n<td>The account uses a LAN Manager (LM) hash. An LM hash converts the password to all uppercase letters, limits the password to 14 characters, and splits the 14 characters into two groups of seven characters. This process weakens the password, so cybercriminals are more likely to crack it.</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AES Encryption</td>\n<td>The account doesn't use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt the user's password. AES encrypts passwords with a 128-bit or 256-bit key. So, passwords that use AES encryption are less vulnerable to attacks.</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing Pre-Authentication</td>\n<td>The account doesn't require pre-authentication, so the account may be unprotected from password-guessing attacks. Pre-authentication encrypts a timestamp of the log-in request by using a key that is based on the user's password. This process protects against password-guessing attacks because it records each attempt to log in to the account.</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To learn how you can resolve these vulnerabilities, see the <a href='#h_01HA0HJ1N03Z4QRCRZDEJ3PBCA'>Resolving Your Vulnerabilities</a> section below.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HA0HJ1N0KA1D4QSA0AAT2SKT'>Copying Your API Token</h2>\n<p>To connect the PasswordIQ client to your KSAT console, you'll need your <strong>Product API Token</strong>.</p>\n<p>To create and copy your API token, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT account.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>PasswordIQ</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>PasswordIQ Client Setup</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the<strong>Token Name</strong> field, enter a name for your token.</li>\n<li>Select an <strong>Expiration Date</strong> for the token.</li>\n<li>Select a <strong>User</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Create Token</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the Product API Token pop-up window that opens, click the PasswordIQ API token to copy the token.

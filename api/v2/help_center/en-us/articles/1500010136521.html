  "body": "<p>In your organization, some users may move into different roles. This also means that those users may need to switch to a different managed account. Before switching a user to a new account, note that a user cannot use the same email address in two accounts simultaneously. Users can only use their email address in one account at a time.</p>\n<p>This article outlines how to move users between different accounts. As well as how to maintain the user\u2019s original account information. It also explains how to use their original email address on a new account.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HBGRRWG3Y47RHEY9T4FT8MQ9'>Enabling Movement Between Managed Accounts</h2>\n<p>To move users between two managed accounts, you must first enable the appropriate setting on both accounts. Follow the steps below to allow the movement of users between managed accounts.</p>\n<p>Account A represents the originating account, and Account B represents the destination account.</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>\n<a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/requests/new' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Submit a support request</a> to have the <strong>Modify email addresses of archived users synced to another KnowBe4 account</strong> feature added to your managed accounts.</li>\n<li>Ensure that the <strong>Has Shared Domains</strong> setting is enabled in both Account A and Account B.

When you enable this feature on Account B, it lets you sync the email addresses of the archived users to another KnowBe4 account.</div>\n</div>\n<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/reseller/usermoves.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/reseller/usermoves.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Users</strong> tab at the top of the page.</li>\n<li>\n<a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204367808'>Archive</a> the user you want to move.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01HBGRRWG3ME2A1N35C9CAJDVD'>Moving a User from One Account to Another Account</h2>\n<p>Use the following steps to update your user provisioning so you can move a user from one account to another.Account A represents the originating account and Account B represents the destination account.</p>\n<p>For more information on this, see <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000154727-User-Provisioning' target='_self'>our articles on User Provisioning</a>.</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>In your user provisioning application for Account A, remove the user account you want to move to Account B.</li>\n<li>Navigate to your user provisioning application for Account B.</li>\n<li>Add the user account you want to move from Account A.</li>\n<li>When your user provisioning configuration for Account A syncs with KnowBe4, the user will be archived in Account A. The user must be archived in order to move accounts.</li>\n<li>Once your user provisioning configuration for Account B syncs with KnowBe4, an <strong>Email addresses already used</strong> error will appear. This will cause the user's email to update for Account A. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/reseller/usermoves2.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/reseller/usermoves2.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>The next time the user provisioning for Account B syncs with KnowBe4, the account for the user will be automatically created.\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong> The <strong>User Provisioning Sync Report</strong> for Account B lists the error from step 5. This error causes the user's primary email address to be updated. Once this happens, the user's alias addresses are deleted. The error will be removed once the user movement process is completed.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After completing the steps above, the user account is moved. The original account will display a \"+Archived\" text in their email address. For example, Bob@kb4-demo.com will change to Bob+Archived@kb4-demo.com. The user provisioning configuration will sync with KnowBe4 again. After that, Account B will create a new user account. It will use the original email address of the user.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Syncs in test mode will not update the account\u2019s primary email address.</div>\n</div>\n<p>To move a user back to their original account, repeat the steps above. Then, have an admin merge the new account with the original archived account. This archived account will keep all user phishing and training history.</p>\n<p>For further assistance with this feature, please contact our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063177973'>support team</a> and they will be happy to help.</p>",

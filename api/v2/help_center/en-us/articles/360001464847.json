Question:</strong> What is the difference between a template and a scope?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A template is a framework, or collection, of requirements that relate to one another. A scope is a set of requirements that relate to one another and describe the boundaries of a project or audit framework. We recommend that you create a scope by converting a template to a scope.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about templates and scopes, see the articles listed below:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115016129608-KCM-GRC-Glossary-of-Compliance-Terms' target='_self' rel='noopener'>Glossary of Compliance Terms</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046400313' target='_self'>Compliance Management Module Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045245034' target='_self'>How to Create Custom Templates for Scopes</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046703714' target='_self'>How to Convert a Template to a Scope</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a name='TemplateTypes'></a></p>\n<p><strong>2. Question: </strong>What types of templates can I use in my KCM GRC platform?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> KCM GRC has four types of templates that you can use in your platform. To learn how to use each template, see the list below:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Custom Templates</strong>: You can use custom templates in the Compliance Management module to select requirements that you will work toward under a scope. Custom templates are most useful if your organization has unique compliance objectives that our managed templates do not cover. For information about creating custom templates, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045245034' target='_self'>How to Create Custom Templates for Scopes</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Managed Templates</strong>: You can use a managed template in the Compliance Management module to convert the template into a scope. Managed templates already include requirements, so they are a simple alternative to creating a custom template. After you convert a managed template to. a scope, you can create or map additional requirements, or you can unmap requirements that do not apply to your organization. For information about the managed templates that we offer, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022753993-KCM-GRC-Managed-Templates' target='_self'>Managed Templates</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Policy Templates</strong>: You can use policy templates in the Policy Management module to document your organization's policies. Your KCM GRC account offers ten policy templates that you can download and customize for your organization. For information about customizing policy templates and the policy templates that we offer, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006135402-KCM-GRC-Policy-Templates' target='_self'>Policy Templates</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Risk Templates</strong>: You can use risk templates to add risks from our master risk repository to your <strong>Risk Register</strong>. Risk templates have pre-populated names and descriptions, and you can customize details such as the risk status, likelihood, and impact. Risks that you import to or create from your <strong>Risk Register</strong> also appear in the <strong>Risk Templates\u00a0</strong>area of your platform. For more information about risk templates, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010296394-KCM-GRC-Risk-Management-Risk-Templates' target='_self'>Risk Templates</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Questionnaire Templates</strong>: You can use questionnaire templates in the Vendor Risk Management module to create questionnaires that you will send to your vendors. KCM GRC offers questionnaire templates for the Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) questionnaire and the Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ). For more information about questionnaire templates, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021582594' target='_self'>Creating and Configuring Questionnaires</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a name='ConvertScopes'></a></p>\n<p><strong>3. Question: </strong>I\u2019ve converted my template to a scope. What should I do next?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>Now that you have converted your template to a scope, the next step is to complete a scope self-assessment for the scoped requirements. The scope self-assessment can help you see how much progress your organization has made in meeting the requirements for the scope. This information can help you determine which requirements you can quickly create controls for in your platform and which requirements your organization will need to work on. \u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036241614' target='_self'>How to Complete a Scope Self-Assessment</a> article.</p>\n<p><a name='AddReqstoScope'></a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Question: </strong>How do I map requirements to my scope?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\u00a0To learn how to map existing requirements to a scope, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405055443091#MAPPING' target='_self'>Mapping Requirements to Scopes</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405055443091' target='_self'>How to Add and Remove Scoped Requirements</a> article.

Question: </strong>When uploading or creating a new requirement, what is the default ID Separator?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>When you add new requirements to your platform, you can set the type of character to use between the numbers or letters that make up your <strong>Requirement ID</strong><em>. </em>This character is known as the<strong> ID Separator</strong>. The <strong>Requirement ID</strong> is a combination of the requirement's\u00a0<strong>Primary ID</strong> and <strong>Sub ID</strong>. The <strong>ID Separator</strong> will display between the <strong>Primary ID</strong> and <strong>Sub ID</strong>.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> The <strong>Requirement ID</strong> determines the order that your requirements will display in templates and scopes. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045245034' target='_self'>How to Create Custom Templates for Scopes</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<p>To set the ID separator character, you will select one of the following options from the <strong>ID Separator</strong> drop-down menu:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><strong>Space Separated ( )</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Comma Separated (,)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dash Separated (-)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dot Separated (.)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do not select a seperator from this drop-down menu, the default separator will be used. If your <strong>Primary ID</strong>\u00a0and <strong>Sub IDs</strong> only contain numbers, the default separator will be a period. If your <strong>Primary ID</strong> and <strong>Sub IDs</strong> contain numbers and letters, the default separator will be a space.</p>\n<p><a name='ExportScope'></a></p>\n<p><strong>6. Question:</strong> Can I download a report of my scope with control, task, and evidence details?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.

Question: </strong>How do I completely remove all scopes and controls in our account?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>To remove controls and scopes from your account, follow the steps listed below:</p>\n<p>First, delete your controls by following the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>From your navigation panel, select the\u00a0<strong>Controls</strong> tab.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Select a control name to open a control.\u00a0\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>When deleting multiple controls, we recommend right-clicking the control name and opening the control in a new tab or window, instead.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Delete\u00a0</strong>button at the top of the page. Once prompted, click <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>\n<li>Repeat these steps as needed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Next, delete your scopes by following the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>From your navigation panel, navigate to <strong>Compliance</strong> &gt; <strong>Scopes</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Actions</strong> column of the <strong>View All Scopes</strong> page, click the trash can icon next to the scope that you would like to delete.

Question:</strong> What is the difference between a control and a task?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>A control is an action or procedure that you are taking to ensure that you are meeting the associated requirement or requirements.You assign a task schedule to a control. The task schedule determines how often your organization must provide evidence to prove that you're meeting the control. By meeting a control, you are proving that your organization is either partially or fully satisfying the requirement or requirements that are mapped to the control.To learn more, see our definitions of <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115016129608-KCM-GRC-Glossary-of-Compliance-Terms#Controls' target='_self'>Controls</a> and <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115016129608-KCM-GRC-Glossary-of-Compliance-Terms#Tasks' target='_self'>Tasks</a> in our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115016129608-KCM-GRC-Glossary-of-Compliance-Terms' target='_self'>Glossary of Compliance Terms</a>.

Question</strong>: What is Control Health?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Control Health is the percentage of a control's scheduled tasks that are complete. To learn how Control Health is calculated, see the Control Health definition in the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115016129608#CONTROLS' target='_self'>Controls</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115016129608' target='_self'>Glossary of Compliance Terms</a>.</p>\n<p><a name='AssignTask'></a></p>\n<p><strong>3. Question:</strong> How do I create and assign a task schedule?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> To learn how to create and assign task schedules, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050048234' target='_self'>How to Work with Tasks and Task Schedules for Controls</a> article.</p>\n<p><a name='TaskRemind'></a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Question: </strong>What is the KCM GRC task reminder email schedule?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>When you've assigned a user to a task, the console will automatically send reminder notifications to the <strong>User Assigned</strong> before the task evidence is due. To learn more about the task reminder emails, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052578153-KCM-GRC-Email-Notifications-and-the-Email-Digest#CONTROL-NOTIFICATIONS' target='_self'>Control Task Notifications</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052578153-KCM-GRC-Email-Notifications-and-the-Email-Digest' target='_self'>Email Notifications and the Email Digest</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> If a user is set to receive multiple notifications in one day, these notifications are combined into one email digest with the subject line: \"KCM GRC Email Digest\". For example, if a user is assigned to multiple tasks that are due on the same day, they will receive one email which will include reminders for each of the tasks that are due that day.</div>\n</div>\n<p><a name='TaskPastDueFail'></a></p>\n<p><strong>5. Question:</strong> When is a control task considered <strong>Past Due</strong> or <strong>Failed</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can create and assign various <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050048234-KCM-GRC-Working-With-Task-Schedules-for-Controls#DifferentTypesOfTasks' target='_self'>types of tasks</a> to ensure that you are maintaining your organization's compliance controls. For both one-time tasks and task schedules, if the assigned user does not mark a task as complete before the task's due date, the following will occur:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>One day past the due date, the task's status will change to <strong>Past Due</strong>.</li>\n<li>Seven days past the due date, the task's status will change to <strong>Failed</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> By default, tasks will remain in the <strong>Past Due</strong> status for seven days. If you would like to change the length of time that tasks are <strong>Past Due</strong> before they change to <strong>Failed</strong>, you can modify the <strong>Task Fail Interval</strong> setting under your <strong>Account Settings</strong> area.

Question: </strong>How can I see a list of which tasks are not 100% compliant?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Tasks that are not compliant are tasks that are not in the <strong>Satisfied </strong>status. To view a list of tasks that are not in this status, see the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>Tasks</strong> page by selecting <strong>Tasks</strong> from the navigation panel.</li>\n<li>From the <strong>Status</strong> column, click the drop-down menu and select the following statuses:\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><strong>Active</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Failed</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Past Due</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The page will show all incomplete tasks that are either coming due or have passed their due date.\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> If you would also like to view a list of the tasks that are complete but are still waiting for approval from a manager,\u00a0click the drop-down menu from the <strong>Approval Stage</strong> column and select <strong>Awaiting Approval</strong>.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a name='Archive_Delete'></a></p>\n<p><strong>7. Question:</strong> What is the difference between archiving and deleting a control?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If you would like to keep a record of the control evidence or if you believe it could be used again with a different requirement, you should archive the control instead of deleting the control. If you archive the control, the control task schedules will be deleted from the <strong>Task Schedules</strong> tab. However, if you unarchive the control, the control tasks, evidence, control documents, requirement mappings, risk mappings, and the control's health score will still be associated with the control. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405773349395' target='_self'>Archiving Items Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>If the control was created by accident or if it is not sufficient for any further compliance efforts, you can permanently delete it.

Question: </strong>Why can't I preview evidence in Microsoft Edge?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> First, we recommend that you check your pop-up settings. Pop-ups will need to be enabled before you can preview evidence in your browser.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the file is trying to open in Microsoft Office instead of the browser, you will need to disable the Microsoft Office setting in Microsoft Edge.

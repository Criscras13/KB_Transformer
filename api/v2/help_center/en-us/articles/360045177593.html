A control can be a document, process, technical implementation, or any action that relates to one or more compliance requirements or risk management initiatives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sections below provide an overview of how to use controls in your KCM GRC platform.</p>\n<p><a name='GETTING'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J85BEEW45CD4TV3VR1BHRFC1'>Getting Started with Controls</h2>\n<p>You can use controls in the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046400313' target='_self'>Compliance Management</a> and <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010819154' target='_self'>Risk Management</a> modules of your KCM GRC platform.</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>In the Compliance Management module, you can use controls to document your organization's efforts toward meeting its compliance objectives.

    "body": "<p>The <strong>Phish Alert Button (PAB)</strong> allows your users to report malicious emails to help keep your organization secure. In this article, you will learn about the benefits of the PAB and our recommendations for how to implement the PAB in your organization. To see which version of the PAB is best for your organization, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/1500011951662.html' target='_self'>PAB Compatibility Matrix</a>. For general information about the PAB, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Phish Alert Button (PAB) Product Manual</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HD1F1BVPZXXPATM6C3174TV3'>Benefits of the PAB</h2>\n<p>The PAB enables your users to report suspected phishing emails and other malicious emails. If your organization\u2019s mail environment supports the PAB, your users can use this tool to protect your organization from cyberattacks. The PAB can benefit your organization in the following ways:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Your users can use the PAB to report simulated phishing tests or potential phishing emails. The PAB provides an easy option for your users to report suspicious emails without sending the emails directly to your IT team, help desks, or managers.</li>\n<li>When your users click the PAB to report an email, they will receive an instant message thanking them for keeping your organization secure. You have the ability to customize this message, if you\u2019d like. For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Enable and Configure PAB</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Phish Alert Button (PAB) Product Manual</a>.</li>\n<li>When your users report a non-simulated phishing email, we can forward this email to an email address of your choice. We recommend that you set up a separate email address for this purpose, such as phishalert@example.com. For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Enable and Configure PAB</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Phish Alert Button (PAB) Product Manual</a>.</li>\n<li>You can send copies of reported phishing emails to KnowBe4 for analysis. We analyze these emails to learn about new phishing attacks and to create new phishing email templates, such as our Reported Phishes of the Week templates. For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Enable and Configure PAB</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html' target='_self'>Phish Alert Button (PAB) Product Manual</a>.</li>\n<li>When users use the PAB to report an email, you will be able to see real phishing emails that your users receive. You can use this information to make decisions about your defense-in-depth strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01FEPP7KT74A6Y5G2WM9GNMPY4'>Teach Your Users About the PAB</h2>\n<p>To begin the PAB implementation process, we recommend that you enroll all users in a PAB training campaign. With the proper training assigned, your users will learn when and how to use the PAB. Before you create the training campaigns, we recommend that you email your users to notify them about the training. For an example email, see the <a href='#h_01FEPNNYXZPZ3WB2KFC58DQCJM'>Inform Users About the PAB</a> section below.</p>\n<p>We offer several PAB training modules in the ModStore. To learn more about each of these training modules, see the information below:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Using the Phish Alert Button: Basic Use</strong>: This module provides a short overview of the PAB and how your users can use this tool.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Using the Phish Alert Button: Report Suspicious Emails</strong>: This module teaches your users how to use the PAB in their mail environment and includes options for Gmail, Chrome, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft 365.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>When You Report, We Get Stronger</strong>: This module provides an overview of the PAB and explains the benefits of using the PAB in your organization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These modules are available at all subscription levels and can be added to your PAB training campaign.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to create a PAB training campaign, we recommend you choose the following settings:<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phish_alert/PABtrainingcampaign.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phish_alert/PABtrainingcampaign.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>End Date</strong>: We recommend that you choose a Relative Duration of one or two weeks.

See the description above for more information about the training options.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enroll Groups</strong>: Select All Users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enable automatic enrollment for new users</strong>: Keep this check box selected. This setting will ensure all new users are assigned the training.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Notifications</strong>: At a minimum, you\u2019ll want to add a Welcome notification to notify your users of their enrollment in PAB training. We also recommend that you add one to two reminder notifications to encourage users to complete the training prior to the training due date.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information on how to set up training campaigns, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204948207.html'>Training Campaigns Guide</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01FEPNNYXZPZ3WB2KFC58DQCJM'>Inform Users About the PAB</h2>\n<p>We recommend that you inform your users about the PAB. In the section below, we have included two customizable emails that you can send to your users to inform them about the PAB.</p>\n<p>The first email informs your users that they\u2019ve been enrolled in optional PAB training before the PAB is installed.</p>\n<p>The second email introduces the PAB and explains how your users should use this tool. Included the email template are links to all of our PAB articles for users. You can select the article that you\u2019d like to send to your users based on your PAB installation method.</p>\n<p>Click the emails in the drop-down list below to see the template for each email.</p>\n<ul class='js-toggles' role='list'>\n<li title='Email 1 - Inform Your Users About PAB Training'>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> We recommend that notify your users about their PAB training prior to beginning the training campaign. We also recommend that you send training notifications to your users to inform them about their training and remind them to take their training.

In the PAB test campaign, you can test the PAB and monitor the campaign results to see if the PAB works for your users. To create the test campaign, you will create a phishing campaign with a custom template.

  "body": "<p>This article outlines the minimum and recommended requirements for streaming our training and video modules and provides information on how our modules are optimized for various internet connections.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVMBNQQB6P7JXF9F2JMC9G0'>Streaming Requirements</h2>\n<p>A stable internet connection is essential for a smooth learning experience.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JEVMBVWCC6N4HZPKCGY9ZCVQ'>Minimum Requirements</h3>\n<p>The minimum requirements needed for streaming are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.5 Mbps download speed</li>\n<li>0.5 Mbps upload speed</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01JEVMCAAC5C2EP9JR8HNRJ69V'>Recommended Speeds</h3>\n<p>For a smoother experience with streaming, we recommend the settings below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 Mbps download speed or higher</li>\n<li>1 Mbps upload speed or higher</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Actual performance may vary based on course content, additional features, and network conditions. Higher speeds may be necessary for simultaneous multi-user access.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVMCX2R7P890ACD96J26QXW'>Training and Video Module Optimization</h2>\n<p>Our modules and videos are optimized for both high- and low-bandwidth environments using the two key approaches outlined below.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JEVMD2XVRVC1DYP3SPY5J31P'>Adaptive Resolutions</h3>\n<p>We offer four adaptive resolutions for our training and video modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>360p</li>\n<li>480p</li>\n<li>720p</li>\n<li>1080p</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For clarity, 480p is DVD quality, and 1080p is High-definition (HD) quality.</p>\n<p>The resolution used for the video is based on the connection speed the customer is using to access our platform. Once the connection speed is recognized, our system adapts and plays the content at that resolution. For example, if a user has a slow connection, 360p or 480p is used; if it's faster, 720p or 1080p is used. This feature allows the videos to play in the resolution needed, depending on the user\u2019s bandwidth.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JEVMDJ372BMEMDMR7NEF0HA0'>Segmented Video Delivery</h3>\n<p>Videos are divided into smaller segments for efficient streaming. This approach achieves the following goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loads videos in smaller chunks rather than as a whole file</li>\n<li>Improves streaming performance, similar to platforms like YouTube and Vimeo</li>\n<li>Allows for continuous loading of upcoming segments as the video plays</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two optimization techniques allow a seamless viewing experience across varying internet connection speeds.</p>",

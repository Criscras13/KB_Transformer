    "body": "<h2 id='h_01JESBQXDHH5TPTP8CB79GRS1Y'>General</h2>\n<ul class='js-toggles'>\n<li style='list-style-type: none;' title='What are the goals of Defend?'>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop sophisticated inbound attacks.</li>\n<li>Educate and empower users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li title='Is Defend a cloud-based solution?'>Yes, the servers that automatically process emails are cloud-based.</li>\n<li title='Does Defend only protect inbound emails?'>Defend will scan and implement banners for inbound emails, and data is displayed in the Defend admin console. For outbound emails, we process the emails to remove banners, and we store relationship data to reference when the outside contact emails the user again.</li>\n<li title='What are the minimum requirements?'>Cloud-based email, such as Microsoft 365, is required for Defend to function properly. G Suite is not supported.</li>\n<li title='Will Defend slow down my email?'>No, the analysis is performed in real time and will not slow down the functionality of your email.</li>\n<li title='Does Defend include antivirus scanning?'>BitDefender is integrated into Defend and is active for all customers.</li>\n<li title='Can I turn off any of the warnings?'>Yes, some blue banners can be turned off in the admin console.</li>\n<li title='Is Defend GDPR compliant?'>Yes.</li>\n<li title='What's a false positive?'>When Defend says an email is bad, but it's actually a clean, non-malicious email.</li>\n<li title='What's a false negative?'>When a bad email is sent and Defend doesn't detect it.</li>\n<li title='How do we avoid false positives?'>Defend is initially run in silent mode to help the Defend console learn and understand user behavior and sending patterns.</li>\n<li title='How can I exclude specific users from email scanning?'>If you do not want a specific user's emails processed by Defend, ensure that their email address is not in the Defend user group.</li>\n<li title='Can notifications be set up for Defend?'>Notifications can be enabled in the Defend console.</li>\n<li title='If an end-user reports an email as 'Not Phish,' will that affect future emails?'>This action does not affect future emails because there's capacity for user error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JESBQXDHJFXA41VBGR0B35PQ'>Detection</h2>\n<ul class='js-toggles'>\n<li title='Does Defend scan attachments?'>Yes.</li>\n<li title='How does impersonation logic work?'>\n<p>The logic is non-linear. It takes in many factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sending address</li>\n<li>Authentication results</li>\n<li>Mail route</li>\n<li>Links</li>\n<li>Link text</li>\n<li>Language</li>\n<li>Intro</li>\n<li>Sign off</li>\n<li>Obfuscation techniques</li>\n<li>Images</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all weighted against each other to determine if an email is an impersonation attempt.</p>\n</li>\n<li title='Can Defend block or quarantine high-confidence phishing emails?'>Yes, this feature is a setting controlled in the Defend console.</li>\n<li title='What does Defend scan in attachments?'>Yes, this feature is a setting controlled in the Defend console.\n<ul>\n<li>Links</li>\n<li>Destination of links and if they are on any blocklists</li>\n<li>Link text for any coercive language</li>\n<li>URL for malicious information</li>\n<li>File type</li>\n<li>File name</li>\n<li>Obfuscation of the file extension</li>\n<li>Anti-virus scan</li>\n<li>Javascript scan</li>\n<li>Comparison against malware hashes</li>\n<li>Bit-Defender</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JETXEQSP194YN4PH0QK1JKZM'>Configuration</h2>\n<ul class='js-toggles'>\n<li title='What does the Defend configuration entail?'>\n<p>Defend is fully configured on a customer's Microsoft 365 tenancy and does not require any configuration of a SEG (Secure Email Gateway). Configuration includes the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mail flow rules</li>\n<li>Send or receive connectors</li>\n<li>Distribution group</li>\n<li>Adding an accepted domain</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Accepted domains</li>\n<li>Remote domains</li>\n<li>Connectors</li>\n<li>Public DNS information</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li title='Why does Defend add an accepted domain during deployment?'>When you add your domain to Microsoft 365, it's called an accepted domain. The functionality of an accepted domain means that users in this domain can send and receive mail.</li>\n<li title='How far back does historical analysis look?'>Seven weeks.</li>\n<li title='Who is in scope for historical analysis?'>Any user that is part of the Defend user group distribution list.</li>\n<li title='Do we still need silent mode if using historical analysis?'>Yes, silent mode is still useful for ironing out any teething issues that might be experienced.</li>\n<li title='Is there any delay in emails being sent or received when Defend has been implemented?'>There is an additional mail flow hop, but this is negligible. We process a large percentage of emails within a second.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JESBQXDH4D4N987TJ9BGDQPN'>Security Center</h2>\n<ul class='js-toggles'>\n<li title='What data does Defend store?'>\n<p>Email metadata such as sender, recipients, subject line, timestamp, and message ID, along with details of the analysis that the software has done.</p>\n<p>For up-to-date information, see the Data Processing Addendum on <a href='https://www.egress.com/legal'>egress.com/legal</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li title='What does a failure on DMARC signify when the email is from a webmail address?'>This means the email is likely a phish.</li>\n<li title='How long is email data available in the admin console?'>40 days.\n<ul>\n<li>User: A user mailbox</li>\n<li>Linked User: A mailbox linked to a user account in another forest</li>\n<li>Shared: A shared mailbox</li>\n<li>Other: A mailbox that could be a meeting room</li>\n<li>Processing: A mailbox that is loading or still being calculated</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li title='What should I consider when adding domains and IP addresses to the allow and deny lists?'>\n<p>If you add an allow list entry with no authentication, then attackers could easily spoof the address, and it would bypass Defend.</p>\n<p>To maintain the security of the email system, it is advised that allow list entries be created with the maximum amount of authentication possible. Allow lists should ideally be temporary.</p>\n</li>\n<li title='What happens when an admin deletes an email from the Defend console operations tab?'>The email goes to the user's deleted items folder.</li>\n<li title='What is the main difference between the admin role and the analyst role in the Defend console?'>The ability to create allow or deny list entries.</li>\n<li title='Can the Defend console give an overview of the phishing threats to my company?'>Yes, the Defend console dashboard shows real time and past statistics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JESBQXDHEJ737N6BMCEZR829'>Banners</h2>\n<ul class='js-toggles'>\n<li title='Can you customize the banners?'>You can only decide when banners are shown and whether they are formatted as inserted images or HTML.</li>\n<li title='Can you edit the wording on the banners?'>No.</li>\n<li title='Can you edit the color of the banners?'>No.</li>\n<li title='What languages does Defend support?'>English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Norwegian, and Hungarian.</li>\n<li title='Will emails sent to quarantine be marked with banners by the Defend features?'>If Microsoft quarantines the email before it gets through Defend, it won't be bannered. However, if the email bypasses Microsoft upon entry into your environment and does reach Defend, it will be bannered and then sent to quarantine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JESBQXDHX87FMFKHGKHPEGRE'>Link Scanning or Rewriting</h2>\n<ul class='js-toggles'>\n<li title='How does URL rewriting work?'>When rewriting URLs, Defend looks at three key things to determine if a particular link is bad. First, we check existing block lists, and then we look at the age of the domain. The number of hops and locality of each hop to reach the end destination are also analyzed.</li>\n<li title='Does Defend rewrite links in attachments?'>No.</li>\n<li title='Does Defend scan QR codes to detect malicious links?'>Yes. However, the end URL does not get rewritten.</li>\n</ul>",

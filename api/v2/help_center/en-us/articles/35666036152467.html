    "body": "<p>The Defend quarantine feature leverages Microsoft's quarantine to determine what happens when Defend classifies an email as a dangerous phishing email.

If you do not have this rule set, you will see the following message:</div>\n</div>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000002SSmb.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000002SSmb.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JE41HRGFSJF49QBBE06F2AP6'>Notifications</h2>\n<p>Since the Defend quarantine process leverages Microsoft's quarantine, this feature does not natively alert or notify when an email has been quarantined. This process is due to the fact that Defend uses a transport rule to send dangerous emails to quarantine. However, should you wish to be alerted, there is an additional Microsoft transport rule you can create, which will create an incident report that alerts an admin or specified address.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>When Defend sends an email to quarantine, you will know that Defend did this because the reason field is marked as a <strong>transport rule</strong>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>To do this action, the additional mail flow rule needed should look like the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000002STPJ.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000002STPJ.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JE41HRGFTS5NAN05NQ75J760'>User Release Compatibility</h2>\n<p>Since Defend uses a transport rule to send dangerous emails to quarantine, please note that any user release policies you have in place within Microsoft will not apply. This policy means only admins will be able to release quarantined emails.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K2HAM43BG01PBSNBTWTZA37W'>Enabling User Notifications and Release Workaround</h3>\n<p>If you want users to receive notifications about quarantined emails and be able to release messages themselves, you can modify your Defend quarantine rule configuration as listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Change the Defend rule quarantine action</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Edit the <strong>Defend Quarantine</strong> transport rule so that the action is \"Set the spam confidence level (SCL) to 9\" instead of \"Send to Quarantine\".</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Configure or edit your Microsoft quarantine policy</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure you have a Microsoft anti-spam policy that quarantines emails with SCL=9.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>",

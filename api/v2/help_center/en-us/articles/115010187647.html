    "body": "<p>To protect your organization from security threats, it\u2019s important that you enroll your users in security awareness training. Security awareness training informs your users about common security threats and provides them with tips on how to stay safe from these threats while at work.</p>\n<p>For your first training campaign, we recommend that you enroll your users in a comprehensive module that covers common security topics such as social engineering, phishing, spear-phishing, spam, malware, and ransomware. We also recommend that you add notifications to your campaign to inform your employees about their training and remind them to take their training on time.</p>\n<p>Read the sections below to learn about our recommended training content for your first campaign, how to create your first campaign, and how to add notifications to your campaign. For more information about creating training campaigns, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204948207.html'>Training Campaigns Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2M3HW1R1CG07PX1DM6PEJ9'>Recommended Training Content</h2>\n<p>Before you create your first campaign, we recommend that you decide what training content you\u2019d like to include. For your first campaign, we recommend that you enroll your users in a comprehensive training module that covers important security topics such as social engineering, phishing, malware, and ransomware. Our KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training module covers all of these topics and more.</p>\n<p>We offer a 45-minute module and a 15-minute module of this training. While we recommend that you assign your users the 45-minute module, you can choose either module to best meet your organization's needs. Your users\u2019 progress will be saved throughout the module, so they don\u2019t have to complete the entire module all at once.</p>\n<p>In addition to this training module, we offer a variety of other training content including videos, posters, games, and more. For information about all our available training content, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115001221467.html' target='_self'>ModStore and Library Guide</a>.

To create a training campaign in your KnowBe4 console, navigate to the <strong>Training</strong> tab. Then, click <strong>+ Create Training Campaign</strong>.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>Create New Training Campaign</strong> screen, you can fill out the fields based on your organization\u2019s training needs.

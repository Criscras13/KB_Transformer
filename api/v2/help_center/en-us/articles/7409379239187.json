Due to the recent increase in vishing scams, telecommunication carriers have developed stricter policies and updated their terms of service to prevent vishing scams. These policies do not differentiate between simulated vishing tests and real vishing attacks, which use similar tactics. As our simulated vishing tests are no longer compliant with these policies, using this feature could result in legal penalties for our users. We have discontinued our vishing feature to continue providing a safe and educational user experience.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id='h_01HHFNJDJM4X9TA3FCY56TS794'>How Can I Continue to Train My Users on Vishing?</h2>\n<p>To continue training your users on vishing, we recommend creating training campaigns that include vishing training content.</p>\n<p>To help you get started, see the list of training content that includes training on vishing below:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training</li>\n<li>Phishing Foundations</li>\n<li>Social Engineering Basics</li>\n<li>Social Engineering Red Flags with Jenny Radcliffe</li>\n<li>Cyberspace Mars: Episode 03 - Vishing</li>\n<li>Confessions of a Vishing Victim</li>\n<li>Vishing Challenge Game</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To preview this content and find other vishing-related topics, <a href='https://training.knowbe4.com/app/modstore/public?lang=&amp;s=&amp;wasl=true&amp;od=Desc&amp;op=TranslationCount&amp;toi=10'>visit the ModStore</a> and set the <strong>Topics</strong> filter to <strong>Vishing</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n",

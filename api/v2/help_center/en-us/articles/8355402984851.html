    "body": "<p>If you\u2019re a Platinum or Diamond customer, you can use our <strong>Smart Groups</strong> feature to create dynamic user groups based on a custom set of criteria. By creating Smart Groups, you can automate phishing, training, and reporting processes in your KSAT console.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve never created a Smart Group, we recommend starting with our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8354913796115.html'>What Are Smart Groups?</a> article to learn what Smart Groups are and how you can use them. You can also view our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8293053887251.html'>Smart Groups Quickstart Guide</a> to learn how to create Smart Groups.</p>\n<p>In this glossary, you will learn about the available Smart Group criteria types and how you can use them to automate processes in your KSAT console.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9TQNP04SJNZW538X0888TR8'>Criteria Options</h2>\n<p>Some Smart Group criteria types also include criteria options. We offer two types of criteria options: <strong>Time Frame</strong> options and <strong>Phish Event </strong>options. These options allow you to further customize your Smart Groups to meet your organization\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p>To learn about each of these options, see the <a href='#h_01H9TQNP0498Z54TJ0KWJZKDAN'>Time Frame Options</a> and <a href='#h_01H9TQNP040AWXXWYAGQT1CGCK'>Phish Event Options</a> subsections below.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01H9TQNP0498Z54TJ0KWJZKDAN'>Time Frame Options</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Range</strong>, <strong>Duration</strong>, and <strong>Any</strong> criteria types also include <strong>Time Frame </strong>options.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Range</strong> option is best for Smart Groups that depend on a specific period of time. For example, to create a Smart Group of all users who have failed a phishing test from 1/1/2022 to 4/1/2022, you could use the <strong>Range</strong> criteria option.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Duration</strong> option is best for Smart Groups that should change continuously over time. For example, if you would like to create a group of users who have failed a phishing test in the past month, you could set a Duration of <strong>In the last 4 weeks </strong>instead of setting a specific date range. This option will allow your Smart Group to stay accurate over time.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Any</strong> option is best for Smart Groups that do not depend on a specific time frame. For example, if you create a Smart Group to automatically assign annual training to your users, you could set a time frame of <strong>Any</strong>. In this example, new hires would be added to the Smart Group as you add them to your KSAT console, and existing users would not be removed from the group over time.</p>\n<p>To learn how to set up each Time Frame Option, click the tabs below:</p>\n<div class='js-tabs'>\n<div title='Range'>\n<h3 id='h_01H9TQNP0497TBFXE3M6957G02'>Range</h3>\n<p>Click the <strong>Range</strong> option to only use information from a specific date range. You can use this option to set three types of date ranges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific start and end dates</li>\n<li>On or after a specific date</li>\n<li>On or before a specific date</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on these options, see the table below.</p>\n<table role='presentation'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SmartGroups/2022+glossary+time+range.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SmartGroups/2022+glossary+time+range.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Specific Start and End Dates</strong></p>\n<p>To set a specific start and end date, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the first calendar icon and select your desired start date.</li>\n<li>Click the second calendar icon and select the day after your desired end date.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> The KSAT console calculates date ranges in UTC (-00:00). We recommend adding one day to the end of your desired end date to account for any time zone differences. For example, if you would like to create a Smart Group of users who failed phishing tests between 7/21/2022 and 7/31/2022, set the date range as 7/21/2022 to 8/01/2022.</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>On or After a Specific Date</strong></p>\n<p>To specify your criteria by events that occurred on or after a specific date, click the first calendar icon and select your desired start date. Leave the second date field blank.</p>\n<p><strong>On or Before a Specific Date</strong></p>\n<p>To specify your criteria by events that occurred on or before a certain date, click the second calendar icon and select your desired end date.

The Smart Group will update continuously as time passes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01H9TQNP040AWXXWYAGQT1CGCK'>Phish Event Options</h3>\n<p>The <strong><a href='#PHISHEVENT'>Phish Event</a></strong>, <strong><a href='#PHISHFLIP'>PhishFlip Event</a></strong>, and <strong><a href='#AFTERTRAINING'>After Training</a></strong> criteria types require you to select a <strong>Phish Event</strong> option. A phish event is what happens when a user receives a Phishing Security Test (PST).</p>\n<p>Each email sent in a phishing campaign is a PST. If a user interacts with the email in an unsafe way, that action is considered a failure and the user fails the test. Phishing campaigns can test multiple attack vectors, so a user could have multiple failures from one failed PST. For example, if a user clicks on a simulated phishing link and enters data on a landing page in the same PST, the user will have two failures but only fail one PST. You can use the <strong>Phish Event</strong> criteria type to filter by either one of these metrics.</p>\n<p>You can use the Phish Event options to filter by specific types of failures in your Smart Group. For more information about the Phish Event options, see the table below.</p>\n<table style='table-layout: auto;'>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Phish Event Option</th>\n<th scope='col'>Function</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Failed Phishing Test</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of PSTs that a user failed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Passed Phishing Test</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of PSTs that a user has received and not failed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Any Failures</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of failures that a user has had, including failures from <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/18223402626323.html'>callback phishing</a> or <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/5477041619603.html'>QR code phishing</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Any Failures But Clicks</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of failures that a user has had, excluding failures where the user clicked on a simulated phishing link.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clicked</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of simulated phishing links a user has clicked.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Replied</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of times a user has replied to a PST.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Opened Attachment</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of times a user has opened an attachment from a PST.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enabled macro</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of times a user has enabled macros in an attachment from a PST.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entered data</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of times a user has entered information on a data-entry landing page that was linked in a PST.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scanned QR Code</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of times a user has failed a <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/5477041619603.html'>QR Code PST</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Callback</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of times a user has entered the callback code in a <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/18223402626323.html'>callback phishing</a> email.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Callback Entered Data</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of times a user has entered the secondary callback code in a <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/18223402626323.html'>callback phishing</a> email.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reported</td>\n<td>\n<p>This option counts the number of times a user reported a PST using the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html'>Phish Alert Button</a> (PAB).</p>\n<p>This option includes all users who reported the PST, even if they failed the test before or after reporting it.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Delivered</td>\n<td>This option counts the number of times a user has received a PST.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bounced</td>\n<td>\n<p>This option counts the number of times a user was sent a PST but did not receive it.</p>\n<p>You can view the reason for the bounced email in the <strong>Users</strong> tab of an individual campaign.

This criteria type includes fields from your KSAT console, such as <strong>Job Title</strong> and <strong>Location</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can also include a <strong>Custom Field</strong> to meet your organization\u2019s needs. For example, if your organization has offices in multiple countries, you can add each country to a Custom Field. Then, you can include this Custom Field in your <strong>User Field</strong> criterion to group users by country.

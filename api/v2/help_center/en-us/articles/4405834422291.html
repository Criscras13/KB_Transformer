Ignoring IP addresses can produce false negatives and skew your results. See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/203645138.html' target='_self'>Whitelisting Data and Anti-Spam Filtering Information</a> article for more information. Please proceed with caution.</p>\n<p>The IP Ignore List feature allows you to block an individual IP address or a range of IP addresses to prevent false-positive phishing test failures. Using the IP Ignore List helps ensure that the data provided from your phishing campaigns are accurate. See below for more information on how to use the IP Ignore List.</p>\n\n<h2 id='h_01HQK21SC2MXPHJ8RKK4RX8ZZR'>Accessing the IP Ignore List</h2>\n<p>To see your account\u2019s IP Ignore List, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KnowBe4 account.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Phishing</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Ignore\u00a0IP Ranges</strong> subtab.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From this page, you can ignore IP addresses and see all of the IP addresses that are blocked on your account. You can also remove any failures that came from a specific IP address. To ignore an IP address or range of IP addresses, click <strong>+ Create IP Range</strong>. You can ignore up to 50 IP addresses or 50 IP address ranges.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>Removing failures from a specific IP address will result in all associated campaign failures except for <strong>Data Entered</strong> and <strong>Replies</strong> to be removed.</div></div>\n\n\n<h2 id='h_01HQK21SC2NGY6WQ6CNAGXGYZS'>Ignoring IP Addresses</h2>\n<p>Once you know how to access your IP Ignore List, it is important to know what signs to look out for in phishing campaigns to effectively use this feature. You can monitor campaign failures from specific Ignored IPs by clicking on them in the list.<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Phishing/IPIgnore2.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Phishing/IPIgnore2.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n\n<p>When deleting campaign failures, you will be prompted to make sure you want to delete campaign failures, as they will change your phishing data.</p>\n<p>If your organization notices that false positives are coming from a particular IP address or a range of IP addresses, you should add these IP addresses to your IP Ignore List. Once you ignore an IP address, any failures that come from the IP address will not be recorded in your campaign statistics.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>Campaign-specific landing pages may not display after campaign failures if accessed from an ignored IP address.</div></div>\n",

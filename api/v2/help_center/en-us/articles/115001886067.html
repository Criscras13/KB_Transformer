    "body": "<p>The USB Security Test (UST) can help you find out how your users will react to unknown USBs. If your users open a specific KnowBe4 file on the test USB drive, this action will count as a test failure. On Microsoft Office documents, if the user also enables the macro on the file, additional data is tracked and geo-mapped.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>You will not be required to download or install any software as part of this test. All you will need to get started is at least one USB drive with a downloaded KnowBe4 file and a free KnowBe4 account.</div></div>\n<p>Follow these steps to complete your USB Security Test:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Sign up for a free account at <a href='https://training.knowbe4.com/' target='_self'>https://training.knowbe4.com/</a>, and then check your email for a confirmation link from KnowBe4.</li>\n<li>Click the confirmation link to activate your account and set up your password.\n<div class='callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>When signing up, be sure to use your email address from your organization's domain, rather than your personal email.</div></div>\n\n<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='http://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/UST/UST1.png'><img src='http://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/UST/UST1.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>After you set up your password, log in to <a href='https://training.knowbe4.com/'> https://training.knowbe4.com.</a> \u00a0</li>\n<li>\u00a0In the <strong>Free USB Security Test</strong> section at the bottom of the page, click <strong>Get Started</strong>\u00a0to begin.\n<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/UST/UST2.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/UST/UST2.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>Download one or more of the files you see on screen.

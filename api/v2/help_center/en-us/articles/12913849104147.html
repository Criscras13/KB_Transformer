    "body": "<p>The PhishER Blocklist feature helps you to prevent malicious or spam emails from reaching your users\u2019 inboxes. When you review users' reported emails, you can update your blocklist to send information about threats or spam to your Microsoft 365 mail server.</p>\n<p>Once you enable the blocklist and connect it to your mail server, you can create and manage your blocklist entries. Each entry contains information that your mail server will use to filter future messages. For example, if you create an entry for a malicious email address, your mail server will move future emails from that email address to your users' Junk folders automatically.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the PhishER Blocklist, read the sections below.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9GRS85MQVZ9136M8Q4RYRRG'>Enabling and Authorizing the PhishER Blocklist</h2>\n<p>Before you can create entries, you\u2019ll need to enable the PhishER Blocklist.

Include a link for them to click. Make it sound very urgent and serious, but apologetic for the short timeline.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Business Email Compromise/CEO Fraud</td>\n<td>Make a friendly-sounding template that looks like it is coming from our CEO. Have the CEO ask the user to please review the attached document they\u2019ve created and provide feedback as soon as possible. The CEO should also say they understand it is an unusual request, but they were told the user is very good at this kind of thing.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A coworker sharing a funny video</td>\n<td>Create a template that looks like it is coming from a coworker who shares a fake video link to what the coworker says is a very funny video. The link should look like it is taking the user to YouTube. Encourage the user to watch the video. The tone should be casual and funny.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tickets for an upcoming concert</td>\n<td>Create a template that looks like it\u2019s coming from a local radio, saying that the user has won tickets for an upcoming concert. The link should look like it\u2019s taking the user to the radio\u2019s website. Make it sound very time-sensitive, and that they have to click soon or risk losing the tickets.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Calendar event from a coworker</td>\n<td>Make a template that appears like a calendar invite. This email should look like it\u2019s an automated message from the user\u2019s calendar app with a link to the invite.</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n</table>\n<h2 id='h_01JJSYEGJB9RKCCG8FEV3TJK1F'>Creating Your Callback Phishing Template</h2>\n<p>You can generate AI-based callback phishing templates.

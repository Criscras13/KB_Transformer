You can download a user\u2019s reply from the KSAT console and review it to help identify what additional training the user needs. To learn more, see the guide below or watch our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115003526587.html'>Reply-To Phishing</a> video.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HAVRY77RGBJG899KMDTJXBEK'>Setting Up Reply-To Phishing</h2>\n<p>To enable reply-to phishing, navigate to the <strong>Phishing </strong>tab in your KSAT console and click the <strong>+ Create Phishing Campaign </strong>button.

    "body": "<p>If you have board members or employees who do not have email addresses at your domain and you need to assign them security awareness training, you can do this within your KSAT console by using dummy email addresses for those users. For example, if you had a board member named John Smith, their dummy email address would be something like John.Smith@example.com.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind the domain that you use in this dummy email address must either be your KnowBe4 account's primary domain or a domain that has been allowed for your account. Email addresses of publicly-available email services like Hotmail and Gmail are not allowed.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1V0PSPENPYP2BKN46QF8AC'>Adding Your Users</h2>\n<p>To set up training for your users who do not have email addresses from your domain, you can use two methods: using quick import and importing a CSV file. Both of these methods are discussed in the next two sections of this article.</p>\n<div class='callout-warning'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>If you are using Active Directory Integration (ADI), users with dummy email addresses will be removed during your next AD sync unless you prevent those users from being managed by AD. To prevent users from being managed by AD, navigate to each user and click <strong>Edit</strong>. Then, select <strong>click here</strong> in the green banner at the top of the page.\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01HS1V0PSP73SP3MBEKQW57DXF'>Adding Users Through Quick Import</h3>\n<p>In order to add users through quick import, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT console.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Users</strong> &gt; <strong>Import Users</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Quick Import</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the box below the <strong>Quick Import</strong> button, paste a list of your dummy email addresses, one per line, with no commas or spaces. Remember, these do not have to be real email addresses from your domain. Think of it more as a login so your users can access training.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Password for Users</strong> check box.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> You can select the <strong>Require users to reset initial password set by admins</strong> check box to require users to change their set passwords after their first login.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Enter a basic password for your users in the field below the check box.There is no sensitive data on the training module page, so this password does not need to be complex. However, you can advise your users to change their password upon login if you wish.\u00a0\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>You must set the password here in order for your users to be able to log in.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Click<strong> Import Users</strong>.\u00a0</li>\n<li>After you import the users, include them in a training campaign and instruct them to log into their accounts with the email and password you created.</li>\n<li>Send a link to your KnowBe4 training login page. See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360043196354.html' target='_self'>KnowBe4's Training Instances</a> article for a full list of login links.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>If you have Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) enabled on your account, add the subdirectory <strong>/ui/users/login</strong>. For example, https://training.knowbe4.com<strong>/ui/users/login</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01HS1V0PSPPTRZZTYH8C41EWM9'>Adding Users by CSV File</h3>\n<p>To add users with a CSV file, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT console.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Users</strong> &gt; <strong>Import Users</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>CSV Import</strong>.</li>\n<li>In your CSV file, include two fields: \"Email Address\" and \"Password\". Under the <strong>Email Address</strong> field, include the users' dummy email addresses line by line. Under the <strong>Password</strong> field, set a basic password for each of your users. The password you set for them does not need to be complex, and it can be the same password for all your users. However, you should advise your users to change their password upon login.\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>You must set the password here in order for your users to be able to log in. Set the <strong>Provisioning Managed</strong> header to <strong>False</strong> to ensure no accounts are archived. For more information about the <strong>Provisioning Managed</strong> field, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204873347.html' target='_self'>How to Import Users with a CSV File</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>You can select the <strong>Require users to reset initial password set by admins</strong> check box to require users to change their set passwords after their first login.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Import your CSV file.</li>\n<li>After you import the users, include them in a training campaign and instruct them to log into their accounts with the email and password you created.</li>\n<li>Send a link to your KnowBe4 training login page.

This will result in skewed campaign results for the Phish-prone Percentage since that this number is calculated based on the total number of intended recipients. To prevent bounces and skewed campaign results, you should use groups for your Phishing Security Tests.</p>\n<p>We recommend creating a group that contains all of your users with real email addresses. You can name this group something like \u201cPhishable Users\u201d or \u201cReal Emails\u201d.\u00a0 After setting up this group, when you create a Phishing Security Test, select this group rather than <strong>All Users</strong>.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong><strong>Note</strong>:</strong> Since training notifications and emails cannot be sent to the users with dummy addresses from the KSAT console, admins will have to set up an alternate method to send the training information to those users.</div>\n</div>",

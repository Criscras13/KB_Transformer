After creating your Smart Groups, all managers should be added to a static group for Security Role permissions.

Under the <strong>General</strong> tab, add read permissions to <strong>Users &amp; Groups</strong> with the targeted Smart Groups.</p>\n<p>You can also create <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360001547908.html' target='_self'>custom notifications</a> for your managers to include information such as the organization's goal to reduce risk with phishing simulations, the employee's risk to the organization, and instructions for how the manager should proceed. Once the notifications are created, set up a training campaign with the following settings to start after each monthly phishing test:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Campaign Name</strong>: Manager Notification</li>\n<li>\n<strong>End Date</strong>: No End Date</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content</strong>: Choose training content for the campaign, such as the <strong>Spot the Phish</strong> game - this will be available in the <strong>Optional</strong> library of your users who are in the Reporting Smart Groups.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enroll Groups</strong>: Targeted Smart Groups from the first step.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Notification Type</strong>: <strong>Welcome</strong> for <strong>Manager</strong> and select the custom notification you created next to the manager field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start the notification campaign after each monthly phishing campaign closes. Allow the campaign to run for one day, and then close the training campaign to remove the training content from your users\u2019 library. After monthly phishing campaigns close, clone the previous training campaign to send new notifications of which employees have repeated failures.</p>\n\n<h2 id='h_01HGBKC78FMYTEBQ583YB7WDJP'>Users who have received more than [X] SecurityTips from the [X] real-time coaching campaign(s) in the past [X] month(s)<strong></strong>\n</h2>\n<p>For instance, multiple users may receive SecurityTips from the same real-time coaching campaign.

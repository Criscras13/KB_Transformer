Therefore, a hacker may buy <em>Cnowbe4.com </em>for the potential of a bitsquatting attack.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Insertion:</strong> An additional number or letter is added somewhere within your domain.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Vowel-swap:\u00a0</strong>A vowel existing in your domain is replaced with a different vowel.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Addition:\u00a0</strong>An additional letter is added to the end of your domain name.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Subdomain: </strong>Your domain is broken by a period, creating an entirely new domain.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>To the inattentive or untrained eye, this could appear to be a subdomain of your real domain.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Homoglyph: </strong>Using foreign\u00a0characters to spell seemingly recognizable domains.\u00a0Punycode is the system used to convert characters that can't be written in ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) into an ASCII encoding.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>These foreign characters can look very similar to letters in the English alphabet.

Domain names are associated with and identify one or more IP addresses. They're used in URLs to identify and access web pages.\u00a0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP</td>\n<td>The IPv4 address associated with the domain (if applicable).The IPv4 address is determined from the A record (Address record) included in the domain's DNS (Domain Name System) records.IP addresses are unique numerical identifiers assigned to every device connected to the Internet which are used to communicate with other devices. Web servers and mail servers are examples of devices that have an IP address.\u00a0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IPv6</td>\n<td>The IPv6 address associated with the domain (if applicable).The IPv6 address is determined from the AAAA record (quad-A record) included in the domain's DNS records.\u00a0IPv6 is the successor to Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4). Some domains will have IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NS Record</td>\n<td>The name server (NS) for the domain (if applicable).\u00a0The name server is determined from the NS record included in the domain's DNS records.Name servers are typically provided by the domain's web host, and they provide the ability to access web pages by domain name URLs, rather than having to type an IP address.The results including NS records have web servers available.\u00a0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MX Record</td>\n<td>The mail exchanger (MX) server for the domain (if applicable).Mail exchanger records (MX records) tell the Internet which mail servers accept incoming email for the domain, and where that email should be routed.The results including MX records have mail servers available.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WHOIS Link</td>\n<td>Use this link to navigate directly to the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) WHOIS website to see the full \"WHOIS data\" for the domain owner. ICANN searches databases of domain registrars worldwide to provide public access to data on registered domain names.If a domain is privately registered, the WHOIS information will show information for a proxy company acting on the domain owner's behalf.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rank</td>\n<td>Each result that is a registered domain (private or public) will have a ranking assigned to it.

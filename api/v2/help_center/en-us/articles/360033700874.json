If this is the case, please ensure that your PCs can reach <strong>https://training.knowbe4.com/api/v1/phishalert/</strong> by allowing outbound connections to remote servers on port 443, which is the server URL the PAB is trying to contact with a POST request.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>If you are using the Hybrid or Microsoft Ribbon PABs, the PAB needs to be able to send an HTTP POST request on port 443 to the domain associated with your KnowBe4 account:</p>\n<ul style='margin-block-start: 1.5rem;'>\n<li>If your account is located at training.knowbe4.com:\n<ul>\n<li>us.pab.knowbe4.com</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For all other KnowBe4 account domains:\n<ul>\n<li>*.pab.knowbe4.com\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Example:</strong> eu.pab.knowbe4.com, ca.pab.knowbe4.com, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01JYS74DKAJTW0MP0N96D1PRE4'>6.

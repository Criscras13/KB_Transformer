For general information about the Risk Management module, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360010819154.html' target='_self'>Risk Management Module Guide</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a name='CONTROLS'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J833474N63CQRZA81JX573NR'>Controls</h2>\n<p>In the Risk Management module, you can use controls to document the preventative measures that your organization uses to mitigate potential risks. You can create new controls for your risks, or if your organization has already added relevant controls to your platform, you can map those controls to the risks in the Risk Register. For the full definition of controls, see <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115016129608.html' target='_self'>Controls</a> in our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115016129608.html' target='_self'>Glossary of Compliance Terms</a>.</p>\n<p>To learn how to use controls in the Risk Management module, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360060605553.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Map Risk Controls</a> article.</p>\n<p><a name='RISK'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J833474NK5281EFMTCWHH066'>Risk</h2>\n<p>A risk is a potential threat to your organization. The purpose of the Risk Management module is for you to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks. You can add risks to your Risk Register by using the Risk Wizard, creating custom risks, and importing custom risks. When you create custom risks, you can assign an impact, a likelihood, a status, and a tag to the risks. You can also add additional details to risks, including a description, a category, consequences, and an affected asset. For more information about the Risk Management module, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360010819154.html' target='_self'>Risk Management Module Guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bullet points below are examples of risks.</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Mobile Systems</li>\n<li>Craft Spear Phishing Attacks</li>\n<li>Conduct Physical Attacks on Organizational Facilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Risk Categories</strong></p>\n<p>Risk categories group risks by the area that a risk would affect if it occurred. By default, the <strong>Risk Register</strong> has six categories, but you can also add custom categories. The default categories are Business &amp; Strategic, Environmental &amp; Natural, Financial, Operational &amp; Infrastructure, Compliance, and Custom.</p>\n<p>For more information about risk categories, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360011109733.html' target='_self'>Risk Categories and Subcategories</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360011109733.html' target='_self'>How to Use Your Risk Register</a> article.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Status</strong></p>\n<p>Risk statuses describe the current state of a risk and what efforts your organization can make to manage the risk. The risk statuses are Acceptance, Avoidance, Mitigation, Transfer, Triggered, Closed, and Other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about risk statuses, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360011109733.html' target='_self'>Creating Individual Risks</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360011109733.html' target='_self'>How to Use Your Risk Register</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Tags</strong></p>\n<p>Risk tags c<span>an help you categorize and find your risks. For example, you can categorize your risks by location if you have different risks in different facilities. Then, you can filter your Risk Register by tag to focus on one or more locations. When you create or update a risk, you can create a new risk tag or select an existing risk tag.</span></p>\n<p>For more information about risk tags, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360011109733.html' target='_self'>Creating Individual Risks</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360011109733.html' target='_self'>How to Use Your Risk Register</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a name='DASHBOARD'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J833474NY933VB7N7KTX7MNQ'>Risk Dashboard</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Risk Dashboard</strong> provides an overview of the risks in your <strong>Risk Register</strong>. You can view your Risk Dashboard to monitor your risks by tag, category, and score.</p>\n<p>For more information about the <strong>Risk Dashboard</strong>, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360011382934.html' target='_self'>How to Use the Risk Dashboard</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a name='LIKELIHOOD_IMPACT'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J833474NJ143VS98XYNE6RPN'>Risk Likelihood and Impact</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Likelihood</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong>\u00a0can help you estimate the threat that a risk poses for your organization. You can also use the <strong>Likelihood</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong>\u00a0to compare and prioritize risks. You can assign a <strong>Likelihood</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong> when you create a new risk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about the <strong>Likelihood</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong>, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360010819154.html' target='_self'>Risk Likelihood and Impact</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360010819154.html' target='_self'>Risk Management Module Guide</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Likelihood</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Likelihood</strong> represents the probability that a risk will impact your organization. The <strong>Likelihood</strong> levels are <strong>Rare</strong>, <strong>Unlikely</strong>, <strong>Reasonably Possible</strong>, <strong>Likely</strong>, and <strong>Almost Certain</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Impact</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Impact</strong> represents the potential damage that a risk may cause for your organization. The <strong>Impact</strong> levels are <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Minor</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Major</strong>, and <strong>Catastrophic</strong>.</p>\n<p><a name='REGISTER'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J833474PF8J14F7XNAK94NXW'>Risk Register</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Risk Register</strong> stores all risks that your organization has added to the Risk Management module. We recommend that you add risks to the <strong>Risk Register</strong> with the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong>, but you can also import risks in bulk and create risks individually. The <strong>Risk Register</strong> organizes your risks by category.</p>\n<p>For more information about the <strong>Risk Register</strong>, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360011109733.html' target='_self'>How to Use Your Risk Register</a> article.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Templates</strong></p>\n<p>A risk template is either a risk that KnowBe4 provides or a custom risk that you import into your platform. You can use risk templates to quickly add risks to your <strong>Risk Register</strong>.</p>\n<p>For more information about using risk templates in your platform, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360010296394.html' target='_self'>How to Use the Risk Templates Tab</a> article.</p>\n<p><a name='SCORES'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J833474PC8RCHYMSVGCDWB7C'>Risk Scores</h2>\n<p>Risk scores can help you estimate the severity of a risk before and after you make efforts to mitigate the risk. You can assign risk scores to assess and prioritize your risks.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Inherent Risk Score</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Inherent Risk Score</strong> measures the severity of a risk. The score is calculated by multiplying the <strong>Likelihood</strong> and the <strong>Impact</strong>. You assign the <strong>Inherent Risk Score</strong> to risks in your <strong>Risk Register</strong>.</p>\n<p>For more information about the <strong>Inherent Risk Score</strong>, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360042334914.html' target='_self'>Inherent Risk Score</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360042334914.html' target='_self'>Risk Scoring Guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Residual Risk Score</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Residual Risk Score</strong> measures the remaining severity of a risk after considering the controls that are associated with the risk. This score is automatically calculated by subtracting the <strong>Treatment Score</strong> from the <strong>Inherent Risk Score</strong>. You can view the <strong>Residual Risk Score</strong> from the <strong>View Risk</strong> page.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about the <strong>Residual Risk Score</strong>, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360042334914.html' target='_self'>Residual Risk Score</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360042334914.html' target='_self'>Risk Scoring Guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Treatment Score</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Risk Treatment Score</strong> measures how well a control prevents or mitigates a risk. You can set this score for controls in your account. The <strong>Risk Treatment Score</strong> is also referred to as <strong>Treatment Score</strong> in the platform. You must map a risk to a control before you can add a <strong>Treatment Score</strong> to the control. After you add a <strong>Treatment Score</strong> to the control, the score will appear on the <strong>View Control</strong> page.</p>\n<p>For more information about the<strong> Risk Treatment Score</strong>, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360042334914.html' target='_self'>Treatment Score</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360042334914.html' target='_self'>Risk Scoring Guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a name='WIZARD'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J833474PXZHNK6QGXZ67V0FJ'>Risk Wizard</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> is a tool that can help you identify risks and add risks to your platform. We recommend that you use the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> if your organization has not established a risk management program yet. KnowBe4 provides the risks in the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong>, which all come from the <a href='https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final' target='_self'>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information about the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong>, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360010931634.html' target='_self'>How to Use the Risk Wizard</a> article for more information.\u00a0</p>",

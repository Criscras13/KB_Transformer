    "body": "<p>BreachSim is a data exfiltration simulator. Once installed, it attempts to send test files to KnowBe4\u2019s remote servers using techniques similar to an actual malware attack. If the tool exfiltrates the files, it indicates that a similar malware attack on your computer could also be successful.</p>\n<p>By default, BreachSim will attempt to exfiltrate the test files across the following protocols and ports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP:80</li>\n<li>HTTPS:443</li>\n<li>ICMP</li>\n<li>DNS:53</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the exfiltration test has been completed, you\u2019ll be able to see the files that were successfully exfiltrated along with any files that were blocked by your security software. Your BreachSim results can help identify potential vulnerabilities in your existing security setup.</p>\n<p>Read the sections below to learn how to install and launch BreachSim and view your results.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout_content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> For accurate results, we recommend installing BreachSim on a computer that uses the same programs and security software as your users\u2019 computers.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01J2HGVJG2M31HTM8EG193CW1F'>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>To install and launch BreachSim, you will need to meet the requirements listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>64-bit Microsoft Windows 10 or later</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2016 or later</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01J2HGDX6W756RPBHPB270P003'>Installing BreachSim</h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve verified that your computer meets the requirements in the <a href='#h_01J2HGVJG2M31HTM8EG193CW1F'>Prerequisites</a> section above, you are ready to install BreachSim.</p>\n<p>To install BreachSim, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to our <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/free-tools/breach-simulator'>BreachSim page</a>.

This article explains how to configure and manage AIDA Automated Training options for your users. For more information, view our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/35378649680403.html'>AIDA Automated Training</a> video.</p>\n<p>AIDA is available on the KnowBe4 console as an add-on to your Diamond-level subscription.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01J47VJH8DA530NM26C2B03279'>Creating Remedial Training</h2>\n<p>AIDA Remedial Training is a feature of Automated Training that assigns targeted training to users who have failed phishing tests.

These plans are based on the maturity level that you'd like to achieve with your security awareness program. We recommend the <strong>High\u00a0Awareness</strong> plan to achieve the best results. However, you will be the most suitable person to decide exactly how your organization should implement our services.</p>\n<p>No matter which plan you choose, the foundation of all of our plans for new-school security awareness training consists of a three-step process. This process is listed below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Conduct a baseline phishing test to determine your organization's Phish-prone Percentage.</li>\n<li>Assess your users' current knowledge of security awareness. Then, assign security awareness training for all users to increase their knowledge.</li>\n<li>Conduct ongoing phishing campaigns.

See the below article for a sample email you can modify and send to your internal stakeholders.</span></p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010148647' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>How Can I Engage My Stakeholders In My Security Awareness Training Plan?</a></p>\n<p><a href='#h_01HC01FT972X4VH03YNYE9JN1B'>Back to High Awareness Plan Details</a></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT97A2WW4HJSV6B0BV9A'>Complete a Blind Baseline Test</h3>\n<p>Before you get started with training your users with our security awareness training modules, we strongly recommend that you conduct a blind baseline phishing test to all of your users.</p>\n<p>Be sure to follow the instructions in the below article to understand how the test should be set up.</p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010347968' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Engage My Stakeholders in My Security Awareness Training Plan</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011903453' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Best Practices Guide: Set Up a Baseline Test</a></p>\n<p>Also, you'll want to consider what sort of landing page you will use in your blind baseline test. Using landing pages, you have the ability to i<span>nfluence your users\u2019 reaction to a phishing test. See the below link to learn about different types of landing pages and how your users may react to them.</span></p>\n<p><span><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010417488' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Baseline Test Communication for Your IT or Help Desk Team</a></span></p>\n<p><a href='#h_01HC01FT972X4VH03YNYE9JN1B'>Back to High Awareness Plan Details</a></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT975MGMY2XD5T9CZFF1'>To Prevent Help Desk Overload, Phish Your IT Team First</h3>\n<p>Another option you may want to consider is to send two baseline phishing tests: one to your IT/Help Desk department first, and then a separate one to the rest of your employees afterward. This way, when the rest of your employees begin reporting the suspicious email, your Help Desk employees will be aware of the situation but will also have had the chance to participate in the baseline assessment. In addition, this is a great way to ensure you\u2019ve whitelisted our mail servers effectively, and that your baseline test will reach everyone\u2019s inbox.</p>\n<p><span><a href='#h_01HC01FT972X4VH03YNYE9JN1B'>Back to High Awareness Plan Details</a></span></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT97R0EE2FSZMT1ZGYMQ'>Communicate with Your Employees</h3>\n<p><span>After the baseline test, your employees who received the simulated phishing email may be confused. Those who click the phishing link may worry that they will face repercussions. We recommend that once the duration of your baseline test phishing campaign is complete, you communicate with them that a test was conducted and explain why. </span></p>\n<p><span>You can also use this opportunity to c</span>onvey the importance of everyone completing security awareness training. Letting your users in on the potential threat to the organization or to themselves may increase their participation level once you enroll them in training.\u00a0We've provided a template for this purpose on the below link.</p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576987' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Template for After Your Baseline Phishing Test</a></p>\n<p><a href='#h_01HC01FT972X4VH03YNYE9JN1B'>Back to High Awareness Plan Details</a></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT97754QXRZ1917KWMPQ'>Assess Your Users' Security Awareness</h3>\n<p>Before you enroll your users in Security Awareness training, it's important to establish their current security awareness to see how it improves over time. Assign your users the Security Awareness Proficiency Assessment (SAPA) to test their knowledge of seven different knowledge areas. We recommend you assign the SAPA after your first phishing test but before your first training campaign. Continue to assign your users the SAPA on a yearly basis to see how your strengths and weaknesses change.</p>\n<p>Use the links below to learn more about adding assessments and about the Security Awareness Proficiency Assessment (SAPA).</p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024195754'>Organizational Assessments Guide</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037392654'>Security Awareness Proficiency Assessment (SAPA) Overview</a></p>\n<p><a href='#h_01HC01FT972X4VH03YNYE9JN1B'>Back to High Awareness Plan Details</a></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT97EZP4J4WJRSRNK568'>Enroll Employees in Security Awareness Training</h3>\n<p><span>After your baseline test, you should set up security awareness training for all of your users. Before you do this, you'll want to set up your <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014116634-Learner-Experience-Guide' target='_self'>learner experience</a> and decide if you want to include gamification as part of your training program.</span></p>\n<p><span>We strongly recommend enrolling all your employees in our 45-minute KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training or a similar, comprehensive course in your first training campaign.\u00a0</span><span>You can also add policies to training campaigns and require your users to accept or acknowledge these policies.

The PAB is an add-in for your mail client (</span><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500011951662-Phish-Alert-Button-PAB-Compatibility-Matrix'><span>See our PAB compatibility matrix here</span></a><span>) which enables your\u00a0users\u00a0to report a suspected\u00a0phishing email. The reported message can be a simulated phishing test from KnowBe4\u00a0or a possible\u00a0real cyber attack.</span></p>\n<p><span>For more information about the PAB and how you can inform your users about it once installed, check out the below link.</span></p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013738548' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Best Practices: Phish Alert Button (PAB) Implementation</a></p>\n<p><span><a href='#h_01HC01FT972X4VH03YNYE9JN1B'>Back to High Awareness Plan Details</a></span></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT97AGJY2N1M9MWQ1HKS'>Determine Your Security Culture</h3>\n<p>In order to ensure your security awareness training is as effective as it should be, you should establish a strong security culture. Security culture is defined as the ideas, customs, and social behaviors that impact the security of your organization. The Security Culture Survey breaks down your organization's security culture into seven different dimensions. Use this survey to see which dimensions can be made stronger and how your security culture changes over time. Continue to survey your users once a year to see how your security culture score changes.</p>\n<p>Use the links below to learn more about adding assessments and about the Security Culture Survey (SCS).</p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024195754'>Organizational Assessments Guide</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037393134'>Security Culture Survey (SCS) Overview</a></p>\n<p><span><a href='#h_01HC01FT972X4VH03YNYE9JN1B'>Back to High Awareness Plan Details</a></span></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT97JHF0FS0RA4E6SQZB'>Enhance Your Email Incident Response Management Plan</h3>\n<p>If you decide to use the PAB, or if you otherwise ask your users to forward suspicious or potentially malicious emails to a designated email or department in your organization, you will need a product that allows you to manage these forwarded emails and efficiently analyze and respond to them. PhishER is a platform that can be used for this.</p>\n<p>Using PhishER as a detective security control, your organization can identify potential threats and strengthen your security measures and defense-in-depth plan. PhishER can be used seamlessly with the PAB to manage reported phishing emails, or you can have your reported emails forwarded to your PhishER inbox.

See the below article for a sample email you can modify and send to your internal stakeholders.</span></p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010148647' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Engage My Stakeholders In My Security Awareness Training Plan</a></p>\n<p><a href='#h_01HC01FT989E2W8Q6Q49KZDYGW'>Back to Low Awareness Plan Details</a></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT98TWANAX38G4YB295A'>Complete a Blind Baseline Test</h3>\n<p>Before you get started with training your users with our security awareness training modules, we strongly recommend that you conduct a blind baseline phishing test for all of your users.</p>\n<p>Be sure to follow the instructions in the below article to understand how the test should be set up.</p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010347968' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Best Practices Guide: Set Up a Baseline Test</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011903453' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Baseline Test Communication for Your IT or Help Desk Team</a></p>\n<p>Also, you'll want to consider what sort of landing page you will use in your blind baseline test. Using landing pages, you have the ability to i<span>nfluence your users\u2019 reaction to a phishing test. See the below link to learn about different types of landing pages and how your users may react to them.</span></p>\n<p><span><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010417488' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Best Practices: Choosing a Landing Page</a></span></p>\n<p><a href='#h_01HC01FT989E2W8Q6Q49KZDYGW'>Back to Low Awareness Plan Details</a></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT98QD7ENG2ZSFQXKVDX'>To Prevent Help Desk Overload, Phish Your IT Team First</h3>\n<p>Another option you may want to consider is to send two baseline phishing tests: one to your IT/Help Desk department first, and then a separate one to the rest of your employees afterward. This way, when the rest of your employees begin reporting the suspicious email, your Help Desk employees will be aware of the situation but will also have had the chance to participate in the baseline assessment. In addition, this is a great way to ensure you\u2019ve whitelisted our mail servers effectively, and that your baseline test will reach everyone\u2019s inbox.</p>\n<p><span><a href='#h_01HC01FT989E2W8Q6Q49KZDYGW'>Back to Low Awareness Plan Details</a></span></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT98AVNBH0MR4J9KWJQ9'>Communicate with Your Employees</h3>\n<p><span>After the baseline test, your employees who received the simulated phishing email may be confused. Those who click the phishing link may worry that they will face repercussions. We recommend that once the duration of your baseline test phishing campaign is complete, you communicate with them that a test was conducted and explain why. </span></p>\n<p><span>You can also use this opportunity to c</span>onvey the importance of everyone completing security awareness training. Letting your users in on the potential threat to the organization or to themselves may increase their participation level once you enroll them in training.\u00a0We've provided a template for this purpose on the below link.</p>\n<p><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576987' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Template for After Your Baseline Phishing Test</a></p>\n<p><a href='#h_01HC01FT989E2W8Q6Q49KZDYGW'>Back to Low Awareness Plan Details</a></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HC01FT982Q2GM1ER6T2Q2CZA'>Assess Your Users' Security Awareness</h3>\n<p>Before you enroll your users in Security Awareness training, it's important to establish their current security awareness to see how it improves over time. Assign your users the Security Awareness Proficiency Assessment (SAPA) to test their knowledge of seven different knowledge areas.

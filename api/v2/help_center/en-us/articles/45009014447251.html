Pop-up messages, instructions, and banners will inform you before the final migration. Accounts will be migrated in stages based on their phishing campaign history, size, current running campaigns, and non-migrating system categories. Partner and multi-tenant accounts will be among the last to be migrated.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXE07ERZCEB51DDXFE753G'>What will happen to exclusions and attack vectors? Will all of my template exclusions carry over?</h3>\n<p>All exclusions and attack vectors will transition over to the <strong>Template Exclusions</strong> list. Yes, all of your excluded templates will carry over. Advanced features also offer several new filters for these exclusions. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4410161863955.html'>Phishing Templates Advanced Features Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXF1YMJBARE1A82EKRY7RE'>Can I exclude specific sender addresses?</h3>\n<p>KSAT will try to group templates with similar senders, such as HR and IT, for easier exclusion, but we do not have the option to exclude based on sender address.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXFZ9RYXFGRMGVSFA2PNW5'>What will happen to my custom categories and templates?</h3>\n<p>Custom categories and templates will migrate over into <strong>System Topics</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXGDFRZZM4KFGD7DWME7C2'>Will my specific language categories migrate?</h3>\n<p>If you have custom categories with preset languages, those will migrate. The Localization feature is on by default, and there is no need to schedule campaigns based on languages using legacy system categories.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>Remember that languages for each custom template must be assigned.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXHENRWY9MS30ZR93BG4NV'>When I\u2019ve opted in, do I need to update the template source in ongoing campaigns that rely on legacy categories? Will these campaigns work without changes, even after transitioning from Categories to Topics?</h3>\n<p>Most campaigns should continue running without issue after the transition to advanced features.</p>\n<p>The only categories that will not transition are language-specific system categories. If you have campaigns running with those, then they will likely stop. You must take steps to update language settings and continue phishing. For more information, please see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360060622513.html'>Localization Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXJWCMK3APH03CPR05NSFH'>What happens if I opt out of advanced features?</h3>\n<p>You can reach out to our <a href='https://knowbe4.zendesk.com/agent/home/tickets?sort=newest'>support team</a> for assistance.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If you opt out of advanced features, all currently running phishing campaigns will stop and must be recreated. Once the opt-in process is complete, all remaining clients will be moved to advanced features, and there will no longer be an option to opt out.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXM4A2T1KTVA04D5F24N37'>How can I prepare before migrating to advanced features?</h3>\n<p>Make sure you select the default phishing language in <strong>Account Settings</strong>. This setting will be used if your users have not chosen their own phishing language. You can also set your users' phishing language using ADI Sync, CSV Import, or PAB Language Functions. For more information, please see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360060622513.html'>Localization Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXNK0XW5HJPXPZDFWQ8VKS'>I would like to view the settings of a previous phishing campaign, but I cannot select Edit. How can I view the settings?</h3>\n<p>You can clone the campaign without selecting <strong>Save</strong>, which will display the same configuration details as the campaign, except for the start date. To do this, navigate to <strong>Phishing</strong> &gt; <strong>Campaigns</strong>. Navigate to the campaign you\u2019d like to clone. Select the <strong>three dots</strong> icon under <strong>Actions</strong> on the right side of the console, then select <strong>Clone</strong>.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/advancedfeaturesfaq_clone.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/advancedfeaturesfaq_clone.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXQNN218XWY8YSRTZFH53Y'>I would like to clone my custom templates, but it is no longer possible to clone individual custom templates.

Make sure to add the sender and subject field values separately.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01K5XXRBTP6T0ABK2W39QDM4FX'>Partner, Multi-Account, and Reseller Questions</h2>\n<p>For information about how phishing templates advanced features affect partners, multi-accounts, and resellers, see the questions and answers below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/45009014447251.html'>I am a partner and would like to opt in.

What can I expect to happen to my managed phishing campaigns?</h3>\n<p>If you opt in and have a current managed phishing campaign, those campaigns and templates will migrate. Managed custom templates and categories will also migrate. If you use a language-specific system category, those will likely not continue to run, as localization is now on by default.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If a partner account opts in to advanced features, all of the partner\u2019s child accounts will be opted in automatically. A managed phishing campaign using advanced features cannot be sent to a child account that has not opted into advanced features.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXY87MZ8JNQ620TGNGFVSE'>What happens when one of my child accounts opts in to advanced features before the parent account?</h3>\n<p>If you run a managed phishing campaign, the child accounts that opt in will not receive any further emails from that campaign.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXYQTSXMYS8YPQJMW4B2YT'>How can I export a large number of phishing templates, and where is the Export button?</h3>\n<p>For partners with a large number of templates, export one topic at a time. We suggest emptying <strong>Drafts</strong> before you import them and adding them to a new topic from <strong>Drafts</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K5XXZFKJ7XS44CBX9W7R0BCC'>With reseller accounts, how will migration to advanced features be managed?</h3>\n<p>These accounts will be the last to be force-migrated at the end of 2025 to prevent any disruptions with managed campaigns. These migrations will occur simultaneously at the parent level and roll down to all child accounts. The plan is to migrate these accounts in batches based on the number of seats and child accounts, from smallest to largest.</p>",

    "body": "<p>In this article, you will learn how to use Smart Groups to automatically assign training based on your users\u2019 <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360037392654.html'>Security Awareness Proficiency Assessment (SAPA)</a> scores. If a user gets a low score in a particular SAPA knowledge area, they will be enrolled in training content that strengthens that area.</p>\n<p>For general information about using Smart Groups, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8293053887251.html' target='_self'>Smart Groups Quickstart Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9TNGXNR5C5E66G2D9QWVQZH'>Before You Begin</h2>\n<p>Before you begin, decide what training content you would like to assign to strengthen each SAPA knowledge area. The seven knowledge areas are listed below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Email Security</li>\n<li>Incident Reporting</li>\n<li>Internet Use</li>\n<li>Mobile Devices</li>\n<li>Passwords &amp; Authentication</li>\n<li>Human Firewall</li>\n<li>Social Media</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then, browse our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115001221467.html'>ModStore</a> to decide which training modules you would like to assign for each knowledge area. Make sure you add the modules to your <strong>Library</strong> tab in the ModStore so you can use the modules in your training campaigns.</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve picked your training modules, follow the steps below to build your automated SAPA-based training workflow.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9TNGXNRTC1RT6SCX25VGS00'>Step One: Build a Smart Group for Each Knowledge Area</h2>\n<p>First, create Smart Groups that correspond to each SAPA knowledge area. When you create your training campaigns, you will set these Smart Groups as the campaign recipients.</p>\n<p>Create a Smart Group and name it something identifiable, such as \u201cSAPA: Email Security Knowledge Area\u201d. Then, add the following <strong>Assessment</strong> criterion:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='6'><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/KnowledgeAreaCriterion.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/KnowledgeAreaCriterion.png' alt=' '></a></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Condition</strong>: Select <strong>Must</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2. <strong>Scope</strong>: Select <strong>Any Selected</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3. <strong>Knowledge Area</strong>: Select the desired knowledge area.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4. <strong>Comparison</strong>: Select <strong>Less Than</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5. <strong>Score</strong>: Enter your desired score.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6. <strong>Time Frame</strong>: Select <strong>Any</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After you\u2019ve filled out the fields listed above, click <strong>Save</strong>. Your finished criterion will state:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>User must have scored less than [desired percentage] in [desired Knowledge Area(s)].</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Repeat this process for each knowledge area. You should have a total of seven Smart Groups based on the seven knowledge areas.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9TNGXNRV4VV22AHSCCD2BWF'>Step Two: Create a Smart Group for Low-Scoring Users</h2>\n<p>Next, create a Smart Group for users who got a low score on all seven SAPA knowledge areas. You can use this Smart Group to assign more frequent, targeted training to users who need to improve their security awareness skills across a broad range of topics.</p>\n<p>The ideal proficiency score will vary for every organization. To determine your desired score, use our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000309628.html'>Industry Benchmark Data</a> tool. To find this tool, navigate to the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204218028.html'>Security Awareness Proficiency Assessment widget</a> on your <strong>Dashboard</strong>. This tool shows you the average SAPA score for an organization in your industry and of your size. Use the drop-down menus on the widget to choose the options that best match your organization. We recommend using the industry average as your ideal proficiency score.</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve determined your desired proficiency score, create a Smart Group and name it something identifiable, such as \u201cSAPA: Low-Scoring Users\u201d. Then, add the following <strong>Assessment</strong> criterion:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='6'><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/LowScoringUsersCriterion.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/LowScoringUsersCriterion.png' alt=' '></a></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Condition</strong>: Select <strong>Must</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2. <strong>Scope</strong>: Select <strong>All Selected</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3. <strong>Knowledge Area</strong>: Select all seven knowledge areas from the drop-down menu.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4. <strong>Comparison</strong>: Select <strong>Less Than</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5. <strong>Score</strong>: Enter your desired proficiency score.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6. <strong>Time Frame</strong>: Select <strong>Any</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After you\u2019ve filled out the fields listed above, click <strong>Save</strong>. Your finished criterion will state:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>User must have scored less than [desired percentage] in all of these 7 knowledge areas.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This Smart Group will automatically update each time your users take the SAPA. We recommend assigning the SAPA to your users one to two times per year.</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve created the Smart Group, assign this group to a phishing campaign. To learn how to set up a phishing campaign, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/204239938.html'>Creating and Managing Phishing Campaigns</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01H9TNGXNRCXYJWN7P94M1K4NM'>Step Three: Create an Audit Smart Group</h2>\n<p>Finally, we recommend creating a Smart Group of users who have not completed SAPA. You can use this group as an audit to make sure all your users are being assessed and sorted appropriately into your other SAPA groups.</p>\n<p>Create a Smart Group and name it something identifiable, such as \u201cSAPA Audit Smart Group\u201d. Then, set the following <strong>Training</strong> criterion:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='5'><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/SAPAAuditCriterion.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/SAPAAuditCriterion.png' alt=' '></a></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Condition</strong>: Select <strong>Must Not</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2. <strong>Training Event</strong>: Select <strong>Completed</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3. <strong>Scope</strong>: Select <strong>All Selected</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4. <strong>Assignments</strong>: Select <strong>Security Awareness Proficiency Assessment (SAPA)</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5. <strong>Time Frame</strong>: Select <strong>Any</strong>.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After you\u2019ve filled out the fields listed above, click <strong>Save</strong>. Your finished criterion will state:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Training</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>User must not have completed Security Awareness Proficiency Assessment (SAPA).</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id='h_01H9TNGXNRJZY5GFAWE0J0AVX0'>Step Four: Create a Training Campaign for Each Knowledge Area</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your Smart Groups set up, you can create training campaigns that correspond to each knowledge area. To learn how to create a training campaign, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/226519807.html'>Setting up a Training Campaign</a> video.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to customize the campaign settings as much as you'd like. For information about recommended training campaign settings, see the details below:</p>\n<div><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/SAPASmartGroupCampaign.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Users/Groups/EN/SAPASmartGroupCampaign.png' alt=' '></a></div>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Campaign Name: </strong>Name the campaign something identifiable. We recommend indicating which knowledge area this campaign covers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>End Date: </strong>Choose a <strong>Relative Duration</strong> so each user has the same amount of time to complete the training once enrolled. Choose a duration that matches your organization\u2019s needs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content:</strong> Select the training content you want to assign to your users for this knowledge area.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enroll Groups:</strong> Select the Smart Group that corresponds to this knowledge area.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Enable automatic enrollment for new users </strong>option. This setting ensures that any user who is added to the Smart Group in the future will be enrolled in this campaign.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Notifications:</strong> We recommend adding at least three notifications: one <strong>Welcome</strong> notification, one <strong>Remind After Enrollment</strong> notification, and one <strong>Remind Before Due Date</strong> notification to encourage your users to complete their training.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Repeat the process above to create a training campaign for each of your knowledge area Smart Groups. You won\u2019t need to create a training campaign for your low-scoring users Smart Group or your audit Smart Group.</p>",

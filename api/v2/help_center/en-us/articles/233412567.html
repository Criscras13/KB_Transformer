Once you find the affected image, edit the <strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong> values in the style tag.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>\n<li>To ensure the image displays correctly, send yourself a test email with the revised template.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-warning'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>You may see additional width and height values in your image tag. However, to change the size of your image, you will only need to update the values in the style tag. The additional width and height tags will update automatically. If you edit the additional width and height tags without editing the style tags, your sizing changes will not be saved. <code>&lt;img src='http://www.imagewebsite.com/image.jpg'\n\t\t\tstyle='width:270px;height:340px' width='270' height='340'&gt;</code>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HD22Z60QSQEEM0YQRK8BGZHS'>Images Being Blocked by My Mail Client</h2>\n<p>Some mail clients will block images by default and will ask the user if they would like to load the images in the email.</p>\n<p>Depending on your mail client, you may be able to add the sender address to a safe senders list to allow images from those senders to load automatically. The process to do this will vary based on your mail client. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/206344337.html'>Recording Email Opens in Phishing Security Tests (PSTs)</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HD22Z60QZ779HEMX4GCDDEBC'>Issues with Images from Real Email's Source Code</h2>\n<p>When you copy the source code from real emails, there is sometimes an additional line of text present in the link to the images that will cause the images to break and not appear correctly. You will need to remove this additional text for the image to appear correctly in your phishing campaign. An example of this issue is shown below:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;img\n\t\tsrc='https://d49.googlecontent.com/proxy/CRx4h0ZfGZl09imI3v2ajtpvTHH0qhkAex3OW5b7Fglv0pMWqCb-QDh6NzsDJ8SD6AdA6dgf6X1bx8KS5DMLt4VQWb06xuPA=s0-d-e1-ft#\n\t\thttp://www.imagewebsite.com/image.jpg'&gt;</code></p>\n<p>To correct this, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>From the <strong>Email Templates</strong> &gt; <strong>My Templates</strong> view, select the affected template to open it in the template editor.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Source</strong> button to enable the source code view of your template.</li>\n<li>Review the source code to find all of your <strong>img</strong> tags and ensure the URL for any of the images only includes the image link, which is the link to the right of the <strong>#</strong> sign.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01HD22Z60QTDAXCZ0FZ3N7S6BV'>Issues with Copying and Pasting Images</h2>\n<p>When you copy and paste an image into the phishing template editor, you are only displaying the image locally. For your users to be able to see that same image, you must use a publicly available URL for that image, such as <code>https://www.image.com/image.jpg</code>.</p>\n<p>To correct this issue, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>From the <strong>Email Templates</strong> &gt; <strong>My Templates</strong> view, select the affected template to open it in the template editor.</li>\n<li>Delete the image you copied and pasted and add a new image using one of the two methods below:\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Use an image HTML tag in the source code, such as <code>&lt;img src='https://www.imagewebsite.com/image.jpg'&gt;</code>\n</li>\n<li>Click the image button in the WYSIWYG editor and add the URL for your publicly available image there.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An example of how to add and resize an image is shown below. When resizing, if the common mail client in your organization is Outlook 2013, be sure to add an additional width tag as explained in <a href='#h_01HDHK5058N8M35657YNJQK6QK'>Image Sizing Issues</a>.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FAQ/addingimage.gif'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FAQ/addingimage.gif' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01HD22Z60QJ13MAP6AB47KMVFD'>Preferred File Types for Images</h2>\n<p>We recommend using .png, .gif, or .jpg files when creating or modifying templates in our system.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HD22Z60QBEVEGGPWSM82ZSSC'>Images Not Displaying When Previewing Phishing Templates</h2>\n<p>You will need to make sure that the <strong>Show Remote Images</strong> toggle is enabled so that you can see the images that were added to your custom templates. By default, the <strong>Show Remote Images</strong> toggle is enabled for our System Phishing and Training Templates.</p>\n<p>Please note that the <strong>Show Remote Images</strong> toggle will only appear on templates that contain images.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FAQ/RemoteImagesToggle.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FAQ/RemoteImagesToggle.png' alt=''> </a></p>",

When should I use each one?</h3>\n<p>There are two add-ins for Microsoft Outlook that can be used independently or in conjunction to provide optimal user experience and security coverage. Both add-ins are centrally managed and can be deployed to use the same policy configuration.</p>\n<p>To understand when to use each add-in, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/39716025786515.html'>Outlook Add-Ins - COM vs Web Add-In</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JRKCBXTGT1FV85ZX0CX6WS4J'>Which version of Microsoft Outlook should I use?</h3>\n<p>This answer is entirely up to your organization. We support all versions of Microsoft Outlook as we offer a Web and COM add-in.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JRKCBXTGANWZBDGCRPWWYZJ2'>How long will there be support for Classic Outlook and the COM add-in?</h3>\n<p>Microsoft has confirmed that Support for Classic Outlook and COM will continue until 2029.

We have raised this with Microsoft to fix it. In the meantime, we have a workaround available for your users. For full details about the workaround, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/39716025668755.html'>Web Add-In: On Send Feature</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JRKCBXTG4HTMC9VA4GSZPP7V'>Do I need to switch to the New Outlook and the web add-in to use Microsoft Copilot?</h3>\n<p>Microsoft has announced support for Copilot in Classic Outlook in their recent roadmap updates, as shown in the <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&amp;filters=Outlook&amp;searchterms=copilot' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Microsoft 365 Roadmap - See What's Coming | Microsoft 365</a> article.

    "body": "\n<p>Defend and the KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training (KSAT) console are a powerful combination to help prepare employees for threats before they materialize. By sharing live email threat intelligence data directly with the KSAT console, organizations can enjoy dynamically populated Smart Groups, allowing for relevant content and simulation delivery on an automated basis.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVWHG52071KEZ9XSFKPFSXR'>Requirements</h2>\n<p>The below items are requirements for the integration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Platinum or Diamond-level KnowBe4 subscription</li>\n<li>Defend subscription</li>\n<li>Performed the steps in the <a href='https://support.egress.com/s/article/Egress-and-KnowBe4-Integration'>Human Risk Management and KnowBe4 Integration</a> article.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVWHG52N7RG9YDD1KYMGA54'>Integration Steps</h2>\n<p>To provide Defend with access to <strong>KnowBe4's User Events API</strong>, you must generate a <strong>User Events API</strong> key within the KnowBe4 admin console. The steps for this process are listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Account Integrations API</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the User Event API.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GEtl.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GEtl.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Enter a name for the API, such as \"Defend\".</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Create API Key</strong>.</li>\n<li>Once the key is generated, make a note of it, as it will not be shown again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The generated key now needs to be entered into the Defend Security Center. The steps for this process are listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to <strong>Settings Partner Integrations</strong>.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GNdi.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GNdi.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Enter your API key into the <strong>User Events API</strong> field.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Save</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVWHG52VW66XXTJZFQS0GSH'>Recommended Configuration</h2>\n<p>For organizations beginning to use the integration between Defend and the KSAT console, there is a broad range of potential use cases that can be catered for. Here are some examples of specific Smart Groups you may wish to create:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users commonly targeted with a specific payload, such as QR codes</li>\n<li>Users commonly targeted with specific phish types, such as business email compromise</li>\n<li>Users new to Defend</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These Smart Groups can be leveraged in your security awareness training program to suit your needs. A key approach to adapting KSAT using Defend's threat telemetry is to adjust the rate of Phishing Simulation Tests (PSTs) based on how targeted the user is. This action allows for more frequent testing of users where needed, driving better awareness and greater accuracy of the KSAT console's scoring features, such as Phish-prone Percentage and Risk Score.</p>\n<p>To configure this approach, we would recommend the following Smart Group criteria, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GPSb.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GPSb.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p>This criterion ensures that users experiencing higher volumes of phish (suggested value of 12 per 30 days) are populated into the Smart Group.</p>\n<p>When creating a new phishing campaign, you can specifically target this Smart Group and choose your desired frequency, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GPsP.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GPsP.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVWHG527741ZF2W974V383J'>Disabling</h2>\n<p>The integration can be removed at any time within the Defend Security Center:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to the Defend Security Center.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Settings Partner Integrations</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Unlink KnowBe4</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GOGQ.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GOGQ.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVWHG52071HDDK36R13KM6B'>FAQs</h2>\n<ul class='js-toggles' role='list'>\n<li title='I have completed the integration, but events are not displayed in the KnowBe4 User Timeline.'>It may take up to 24 hours before Defend events are available in the User Timeline.</li>\n<li title='I cannot find the KnowBe4 section within the Defend Partner Integrations Section'>You must have completed the Defend Azure AD Integration before the KnowBe4 integration will be displayed.</li>\n<li title='What data is shared with KnowBe4?'>\n<p>Enabling this integration shares very limited threat event details with the KnowBe4 platform.

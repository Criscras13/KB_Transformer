    "body": "<p>The Password Exposure Test (PET) is a free tool that analyzes the passwords of the accounts in your Active Directory (AD) for numerous types of password vulnerabilities. Using this test will increase your organization's awareness by letting you know if you're susceptible to a password-related attack.</p>\n<p>The PET results will display which user accounts failed the test, and what vulnerability or vulnerabilities they failed with. This information can empower you to enhance your internal security measures by training your users about password safety, enhancing your password complexity rules, or taking other actions to bolster your cybersecurity posture.</p>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8ETA5ASXJYSSQAW7B89PPCH'>How Does the PET Work?</h2>\n<p>The PET analyzes the following AD information in order to check for weak and vulnerable passwords:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Your AD password table (containing hashed passwords)</li>\n<li>The encryption algorithm of your AD password table</li>\n<li>The primary domain found in your AD tree</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The PET also uses your business email domain to assess the amount of data that is publicly available about your organization.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that this tool will never display or report the actual passwords of any user accounts in your AD. Passwords within AD are in a hashed format and will not be visible at any point. The test results will simply identify the user accounts that fail the test so you can decide how to remedy that.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the data pulled from AD is encrypted. The information obtained during the test is saved in local memory, not to a disk. Your domains are the only data transmitted to us from your AD at any point during the test.</p>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8ETA5AS07CMRBJ523YTNDXM'>System Requirements/Prerequisites</h2>\n<p><strong>System Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>To run the PET, the system you use must have the following:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Windows 10 or later (32 or 64-bit), Windows Server 2016 or later</li>\n<li>Active Directory (AD), running on Windows Server 2008 R2 or later</li>\n<li>Ability to access the domain controller (DC)</li>\n<li>Internet access</li>\n<li>.NET Framework 4.7.2 (will be installed if needed)</li>\n<li>At least two processors</li>\n<li>At least 2GB of RAM</li>\n<li>At least 1GB of hard disk drive (HDD) space available on your system drive</li>\n<li>User Account Control (UAC) enabled</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should also run this test on a system\u00a0<strong>other</strong>\u00a0than your DC\u00a0as the scanning process can temporarily generate significant network traffic and CPU usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<p>For installation, you will need the following information:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>A license key, emailed to you when you sign up for PET</li>\n<li>Domain name of your AD (For example: MyDomain.com or MyDomain.local)</li>\n<li>Name of your Domain Controller (DC)</li>\n<li>Credentials to connect to your AD.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-warning'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong> The credentials you use to connect to Active Directory with the PET <strong>must</strong>\u00a0have<strong>\u201cReplicating Directory Changes\u201d </strong><em>and</em><strong> \u201cReplicating Directory Changes All\u201d permissions</strong> for the test to run successfully. These permissions allow you to obtain a copy of your password table for analysis. For information on quickly adding required permissions to an account in AD, see our <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/303972/how-to-grant-the-replicating-directory-changes-permission-for-the-microsoft-metadirectory-services-adma-service-account' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>How to Grant \"Replicating Directory Changes\" Permissions</a> article. For additional notes on these permissions, see the list below.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>A domain admin<strong>\u00a0</strong><em>does not</em>\u00a0have permission by default to access this information, so using the tool with a domain admin account will not necessarily allow you to run the test successfully.</li>\n<li>We strongly recommend creating a\u00a0<em>new</em> <em>account</em>\u00a0in AD with these permissions for the purpose of running this test. Once the test is complete, you should delete this new account in accordance with the principle of least privilege.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Why create a new account?</em> Creating a new account will make it easier to determine when this test took place and which account accessed the information, should you need to look for that information in the future. It also makes it easier to remove those permissions: once the test is done, simply delete the newly-added user account.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8ETA5ASGCTQGBQ4C9YNX79R'>Installation and Setup</h2>\n<p>Once you have a system that meets the <a href='#Requirements'>requirements and prerequisites</a>, follow the steps below to complete the install.</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Sign up for your free test by navigating to <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/password-exposure-test' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>https://www.knowbe4.com/password-exposure-test</a>.\u00a0Upon signing up, we'll email you a unique license key, which you'll need to enter prior to running the test.</li>\n<li>Download and run the installer file for the PET.

The following table explains each of the primary PET vulnerabilities included in your results.\u00a0</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Weak Password:\u00a0</strong>This failure indicates that the affected account's password matched one of those listed in our Weak Password dictionary. These passwords are either very common, easy to guess, or have been made available to attackers because of past data breaches.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Breached Password: </strong>This failure indicated that at the time of a data breach, the affected account's password matches a password that was associated with an email address at your domain. Your AD accounts are checked against a database of breached data that contains over one billion leaked passwords.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password Info Exposed: </strong>This failure indicates that the affected account has been found in publicly available breaches that contain either cleartext passwords or password hashes. The results for this failure type are found in the fourteenth column in the results table.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Shared Password:</strong> This failure indicates that the affected account shares a password with at least one other account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Empty Password:</strong> This failure includes accounts that do not have a set password.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Clear Text Password:</strong> This failure includes passwords that are stored in clear text in an Active Directory. This means the users' AD passwords are stored using reversible encryption.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password Not Required:</strong> This failure includes accounts that have the capability of not having a password.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password Never Expires:</strong> This failure indicates that the account has its password timeout set to zero. Because of this setting, even if the <strong>Password never expires</strong> check box in the user\u2019s properties is unchecked, their password will never expire. The PET will check password expiration settings in your organization\u2019s domain policies, fine-grained password policies, and user properties.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>LM Hash Password:</strong> This failure indicates that the affected account uses a Local Area Network (LAN) manager hash, which is an antiquated method. These passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks and can be cracked in seconds.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>AES Encryption Not Set:</strong> This failure indicates that the account doesn\u2019t use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt the user\u2019s password. AES encrypts passwords with a 128-bit or 256-bit key. So, passwords that use AES encryption are less vulnerable to attacks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>DES-Only Encryption:</strong> This failure indicates that affected accounts were set up using the retired Data Encryption Standard (DES) mechanism. This could be a result of old software that doesn\u2019t know how to react to AES.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Missing Pre-Authentication:</strong> This failure indicates that affected accounts have an important security mechanism turned off. Without these security mechanisms, the accounts may be at risk of brute force attacks. These attacks can occur offline and are difficult to detect. The security mechanism, when enabled, creates an encrypted authentication request so that attempts to authenticate to the account are logged.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='iv_01H8ETA5ASJSDZ67950EPXG5AD'>Additional Results</h3>\n<p>Your PET results will display information on additional results beyond just the failure types. These additional details and failure types can help to determine which of your AD accounts are the most vulnerable, and therefore in need of the most immediate attention. See the list below for details.</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Domain:</strong> Signifies which Domain is used in the corresponding AD account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sensitive Info Exposed:</strong> The affected accounts were found to have some of their identity information publicly visible, leaving them susceptible to phishing attacks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Social Info Exposed:</strong> The affected account was found to have a public social media presence.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password Last Modified:</strong> The date the password was last changed for the corresponding AD account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Breach Entry Timestamp:</strong> The approximate date that the affected account was last involved in a breach.Please see <a href='#01H8ETA5AS4DWTHJBD0HCCJKCS'>below</a>\u00a0for additional information about where we obtain our breach data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Breach Info:</strong> Describes the type of breach the account was involved in (i.e., how the breach occurred, and what type of sensitive data was leaked as a result (if this information is available)).\u00a0Please see <a href='#01H8ETA5AS4DWTHJBD0HCCJKCS'>below</a> for additional information about where we obtain our breach data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8ETA5AS4DWTHJBD0HCCJKCS'>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>I had several users fail the test. What do I do now?</strong>First and foremost, have the users with vulnerable accounts change their passwords immediately.Secondly, train your users on proper password practices with security awareness training and remind them often. It is important for them to know that hackers can crack a password within seconds with the right tools in hand.KnowBe4 offers several courses covering proper password practices, which can be used to train your users.For many of the vulnerabilities, you\u2019ll also want to enforce stricter password requirements in your organization. We strongly recommend increasing your password complexity requirements and setting a rule to ensure passwords expire on a regular basis.\u00a0While we cannot advise you on the specifics of how to remedy all of the password vulnerabilities in your organization, we can point you in the direction of some great resources that can help.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>TechNet:\u00a0<strong><a href='https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd277399.aspx' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Configuring Password Policies</a></strong>\n</li>\n<li>TechNet:\u00a0<strong><a href='https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff741764.aspx' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Best Practices for Enforcing Password Policies</a></strong>\u00a0</li>\n<li>Microsoft:\u00a0<strong><a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/password-guidance/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Password Guidance</a></strong> (Downloadable PDF)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can I see what the weak and breached passwords are? </strong>No. The passwords are hashed and cannot be displayed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can I run this test if I'm using Azure AD? </strong>No. This tool will only work with a local AD.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can I run this test multiple times?</strong>Absolutely. If you want to run the test again, click <strong>Rerun Test</strong> below the Risk Distribution pie chart. Be sure to download a PDF or Excel sheet of your current results before running a new test.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What is the Weak Passwords dictionary and where can I find it?</strong>The Weak Passwords dictionary contains over 11 million weak and compromised passwords from past data breaches. Hackers use similar dictionaries to attempt to crack your organization's passwords.To find the Weak Passwords dictionary, navigate to the Password Exposure Test installation folder by following this path: \u201cC:\\ProgramFiles (x86)\\KnowBe4\\Password Exposure Test\u201d. Then, open the data.bin file to view the Weak Passwords dictionary.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Where do you get your breach data from? Can I see it?</strong>The breached data shown in the PET is obtained through researching publicly-available breach information. For privacy and security purposes, the PET database is proprietary information. Additionally, KnowBe4 partners with Spycloud.com to search past breaches. Spycloud is a well-respected online resource which specializes in allowing users to search for their email address to see if their information has been made available in past data breaches.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>My anti-virus flagged this as dangerous. Is it?</strong>No, it is not dangerous. The PET\u2019s behavior could mimic that of a password-cracking tool used by hackers, which is why your antivirus may have flagged it as potentially dangerous.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Are any log files generated during the test?</strong>Yes. A log file is created when you run the PET. The file can be found under C:\\ProgramData\\KnowBe4\\Password Exposure Test\\DebugLogs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>I received an error message and my test did not run. What do I do?</strong>If you received an error and could not complete the test, check the chart below for common error messages and their causes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;tr\"&gt;Test was unable to run due to invalid user name and/or password.

Controls are a document, process, technical implementation, or other action that relates to one or more requirements.</p>\n<p>Examples of Controls:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Disaster Recovery Policy and periodic review and testing of the policy</li>\n<li>Active Directory password configuration settings review</li>\n<li>Apply the latest patches to SERVER1</li>\n<li>Collect Security and Privacy documentation from VENDOR</li>\n<li>Review and Document Incident</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend making your control description very detailed. The description should include what the control is, how to review and assess the control, what type of <a href='#EVIDENCE'>evidence</a> is expected as a result of a review, and where that evidence should be placed. If you should need to change ownership of the control's tasks, providing these details will make it much easier for the new user (or <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360049480674.html' target='_self'>user group</a>) to understand what is expected.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The control description is used in\u00a0<a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360012357353.html' target='_self'>Detailed Compliance Reports</a>.\u00a0Additionally, when <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360050048234.html' target='_self'>creating task schedules for your controls</a>, by default, the control description will be used as the task description. Alternatively, you can modify the task description to be specific to the task. The task description is used in\u00a0<a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360001464847.html' target='_self'>task reminder emails</a>.</p>\n<p>Additional Resources:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360049579594.html' target='_self'>Creating and Importing Controls</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360047704014.html' target='_self'>Mapping Requirements and Controls</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360060605553.html' target='_self'>Creating and Mapping Risk Controls</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01J2YBNW4ZZ2G7WWYMFB4DHHMW'>Control Task Schedules</h3>\n<p>Task schedules are created in order to automatically generate <a href='#TASKS'>tasks</a> for a control. Schedules can recur at one of the following intervals: weekly, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually, every two years, every three years, or every five years. A control can have multiple schedules.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If tasks are needed outside of a recurring schedule, you can create tasks on an ad-hoc basis by creating a <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360050048234.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>one-time schedule</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When creating a task schedule for a control, you will assign a user to be responsible for completing the tasks under that schedule. As an alternative option, under our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360049480674.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>user group workflow</a>, the group lead can be assigned to the task schedule, then, the group lead can re-assign the task to another member of their group.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Additional Resources:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360050048234.html' target='_self'>How to Work With Tasks for Controls</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360049480674.html' target='_self'>Working With User Groups</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01J2YBNW4ZX5PCK93MHXT2Z8VR'>Control Documents</h3>\n<p>Control documents are an optional way to submit an <em>example</em> of the evidence documents that are required of the user or users who are responsible for completing a task. While this is <em>not</em> a replacement for the <a href='#EVIDENCE'>evidence</a> that is required for task completion, it <em>is</em> a way to support the act of gathering evidence for a particular control.</p>\n<p>Examples of control documents:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>A blank management sign-off form</li>\n<li>A screenshot of a particular area in Active Directory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, you can use control documents to upload detailed instructions for completing a task. If you do so, when <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360050048234.html' target='_self'>creating the task schedule</a>, we recommend using the Task Description field to instruct the user to review the file that you've uploaded under control documents. From the View Task page, the user assigned to the task can view all of the control documents that have been uploaded to the associated control.\u00a0</p>\n<h3 id='h_01J2YBNW4ZWQ05TCCB6A68DSWK'>Control Health</h3>\n<p>The Control Health is the percentage of a control's scheduled tasks that are complete. This percentage includes tasks with <strong>Awaiting Approval</strong>, <strong>Closed Late</strong>, and <strong>Satisfied</strong> statuses. All completed tasks increase the Control Health by the same amount, regardless of status. For example, a task with a <strong>Closed Late</strong> status will increase the Control Health by the same amount as a task with a <strong>Satisfied</strong> status.</p>\n<p>By viewing the Control Health, you can determine what percentage of a control's tasks you need to complete to reach 100%. Incomplete tasks have <strong>Failed</strong> and <strong>Past Due</strong> statuses, so completing tasks with those statuses will increase the Control Health.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> We do not include tasks with the <strong>Active</strong> status in the Control Health calculation. The Control Health accounts for tasks that are complete or overdue, and tasks with the <strong>Active</strong> status have not reached their due date.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01J2YBNW50ZY053R6QMZ29A6SE'>Evidence</h2>\n<p>Evidence is provided to satisfy <a href='#TASKS'>tasks</a>, in order to support the\u00a0<a href='#CONTROLS'>control</a>\u00a0that you have in place for one or more\u00a0<a href='#REQUIREMENTS'>requirements</a>. Users can submit task evidence by uploading a file (referred to as \"Document\") or by providing a URL (referred to as \"Link\") to the evidence\u2014when evidence is hosted externally from KCM GRC.</p>\n<p>From the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360048963113.html' target='_self'>Documents</a> area of your platform, the Evidence tab contains a repository of the URLs (Links) and files (Documents) that have been submitted as evidence for the controls in your account.

Each file that is uploaded is uniquely encrypted and stored securely in the cloud. Uploaded files are associated with a specific <a href='#TASKS'>task</a>.</p>\n<p>We recommend using the file upload feature if you are not currently using a central storage facility for audit evidence. For more information, please see:\u00a0<a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360001464847.html' target='_self'>Are there limitations for the various files uploaded to KCM GRC?</a></p>\n<h3 id='h_01J2YBNW50CTRNNJ1PQW8Q038Z'>Links (URLs)</h3>\n<p>As an alternative to uploading documents as task evidence, you can provide a link (URL) that points to externally-hosted evidence. If you are currently using a centralized storage area on your internal network for maintaining audit evidence, you do not need to upload files to KCM GRC. By providing a URL to the evidence, you get the benefit of linking that information to a specific control (via a <a href='#TASKS'>task</a>) without storing files in multiple places.</p>\n<p>Additionally, any web-based file storage application can be used, whether it's internal to your network or external, such as Sharepoint, Dropbox, Google Drive, Jira, etc.</p>\n<p><a name='Requirements'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J2YBNW50SYCGPQVKW06NAPBT'>Requirements</h2>\n<p>A requirement is a concrete statement that describes a compliance objective, audit finding, best practice, or another obligation that the organization is striving to achieve or correct.</p>\n<p>Some examples of requirements are:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>PCI DSS 1.1.2 \u2013 Current Network Diagram \u2013 There must exist a current network diagram with all connections to cardholder data, including any wireless networks.</li>\n<li>HIPAA 164.308(a)(2)(ii) \u2013 Facility Security Plan \u2013 Implement policies and procedures to safeguard the facility and the equipment therein from unauthorized physical access, tampering, and theft.</li>\n<li>Internal IT Audit FY2015 \u2013 Finding #4 Missing Security Patches \u2013 The following servers did not have the most recent security patches applied: SERVER1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use requirements from the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360022753993.html' target='_self'>managed templates</a> that are offered by KCM GRC, or you can create custom requirements. As a best practice for creating custom requirements: Add requirements to a custom\u00a0<a href='#TEMPLATES'>template</a>, then, convert the template to a <a href='#SCOPES'>scope</a> to begin working toward achieving your requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Additional Resources:\u00a0</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360046400313.html' target='_self'>Getting Started with the Compliance Management Module</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360045245034.html' target='_self'>Creating Custom Templates for Scopes</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360046703714.html' target='_self'>Converting Templates to Scopes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01J2YBQG0Q1PCVPKXSHK1YA148'>Scoped Requirements</h2>\n<p>When a requirement is added to a scope (by <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360046703714.html' target='_self'>converting a template to a scope</a>, by <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360046399673.html' target='_self'>cloning a scope</a>, or by mapping a requirement to a scope), a scoped version of the requirement is created under the scope. The scoped requirement has a one-to-one relationship with controls. Meaning, if a control applies to a requirement that is included in multiple scopes, you will map the control to each scoped version of the requirement. For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360047704014.html' target='_self'>KCM GRC: Mapping Requirements and Controls</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='Scopes'>Scopes</h2>\n<p>A scope is an umbrella structure to manage a series of related <a href='#REQUIREMENTS'>requirements</a>, <a href='#CONTROLS'>controls</a>, and <a href='#EVIDENCE'>evidence</a>. A scope is a way to describe the boundaries of a project or audit. Under KCM GRC's Compliance Management module, user permissions, and some reports are divided up by Scope.</p>\n<p>For example, scopes can represent separate physical locations; different ongoing compliance initiatives; remediation and audit findings; incident and vendor management; or tracking a project.</p>\n<p>Scopes are typically created from custom templates or managed templates.</p>\n<p>Additional Resources:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360046400313.html' target='_self'>Getting Started with the Compliance Management Module</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360045245034.html' target='_self'>Creating Custom Templates for Scopes</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360046703714.html' target='_self'>Converting Templates to Scopes</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115015826148.html' target='_self'>User Roles Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360012357353.html' target='_self'>Metrics Reporting Guide</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01J2YBNW50XPFMXVX6B27AW7FD'>Scope Self-Assessment</h3>\n<p>Each scope has a set of requirements. Each requirement has a self-assessment status. You can set the status for each requirement under a scope by completing the Scope Self-Assessment.

Exporting your scope information may be beneficial during an audit, or if you need to keep a record of the status of your controls and evidence at a particular point in time. See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360055471473.html' target='_self'>Scope Exports</a> article to learn more.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01J2YBNW50QXZ5VWFWT8K0EP5V'>Scope Health</h3>\n<p>The Scope Health is the percentage of a scope's scheduled tasks that are complete.

They provide an opportunity to collect evidence relating to a <a href='#CONTROLS'>control</a> on a periodic basis, so you will be prepared when it is time for an audit. Tasks are automatically created as part of an ongoing task schedule. Additionally, you can create a one-time task schedule, on an ad-hoc basis. For additional information, see the <a href='#CONTROLS'>Controls</a> section above.</p>\n<p>Automated email reminders are sent to the user responsible for the task when the task's due date is approaching.</p>\n<p>You have the option to assign one or more users to approve the evidence submitted for a task.

A template is a repository or collection of requirements that are related to one another. A compliance template can either be a managed template\u2014which is created and kept up-to-date by KnowBe4\u2014or a custom template created by the KCM GRC customer to suit their needs.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01J2YBNW50R9WDVT0K6ENG0EYJ'>Custom Templates</h3>\n<p>Custom templates contain a group of requirements that a KCM GRC user will create and manage. This can be anything from audit requirements and findings, state and local regulations, security best practices, vendor management, incident management, IT and non-IT based projects, and more.</p>\n<p>When creating scopes, we recommend you start with a template and convert it to a scope. That way, you can continue to utilize the template's requirements for additional compliance objectives, by adding them to additional scopes.

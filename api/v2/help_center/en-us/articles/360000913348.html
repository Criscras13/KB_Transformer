If you receive this email, it means your mail server correctly shares certificate information. If you don't receive this email, it could mean that your mail server has an incorrect TLS certificate, doesn't support TLS, or is otherwise set up incorrectly.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email w/ Soft SPF Failure</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain with a \"soft fail\" SPF record.</td>\n<td>This means the sender is not authorized to use the \"From\" email address domain that it is using. Emails such as this could be potential phishing attempts, spoofing a well-known or trusted entity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email w/ Hard SPF Failure</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain with a \"hard fail\" SPF record.</td>\n<td>This means the sender is not authorized to use the \"From\" email address domain that it is using. Emails such as this could be potential phishing attempts, spoofing a well-known or trusted entity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email w/ Punycode Domain (IDN Homograph)</td>\n<td>Imitates an IDN Homograph attack. Uses a \"From\" email address domain that appears to be another domain by using Punycode.</td>\n<td>IDN homograph attacks can deceive users into clicking on links that appear to be popular, safe websites but are actually malicious sites. A Punycode \"From\" email sender can trick users into believing the email they received is from a legitimate or trusted source.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoofed Email (From address)</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain in the \"From\" email address field that spoofs your organization's domain.</td>\n<td>Emails like this can deceive your users into believing an email they received is safe and can be trusted, as they appear to be internal communication.\u00a0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoofed Email (Reply address)</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain in the \"Reply to\" email address field that spoofs your organization's domain.</td>\n<td>Emails like this can deceive your users into believing an email they received is safe and can be trusted, as they appear to be internal communication.\u00a0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoofed Email (Altered domain)</td>\n<td>Uses a sender domain in the \"From\" email address field that spoofs your organization's domain but uses a different top-level domain (TLD), such as <em><strong>.corn</strong></em> instead of <em><strong>.com</strong></em>.</td>\n<td>Emails like this can deceive your users into believing an email they received is safe and can be trusted. The user may not see the slight difference in the sender email address when deciding how to respond to the email.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Word Document</td>\n<td>Uses an email containing a Word attachment.</td>\n<td>Attachments can be weaponized, even without Macros. For example, malicious links can be embedded within a safe-looking attachment.

Can I still run the MSA and will it be accurate?\u00a0</h3>\n<p><em>Yes! The MSA test emails are not sent from any of the domains or IPs you've already whitelisted. So your existing whitelisting rule(s) will not interfere with the accuracy of the MSA.</em></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HSE98NSDBSP281E9DPHADWY6'>I didn't get the email when I signed up. What should I do?</h3>\n<p><em>Check your Spam and Junk folder. The initial email we send does not contain anything that should be flagged by normal security controls. We don't advise or recommend that you attempt to whitelist anything in order to receive this email, as that defeats the purpose of the test.\u00a0</em></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HSE98NSDRTW2JJ4P9E23GD54'>What should I do about the emails that were able to make it through or not make it through my email security controls?</h3>\n<p><em>KnowBe4 does not advise on what types of emails or attachments you should or should not allow through your mail filter or security controls. The MSA is meant to be an awareness tool to help you understand where potential vulnerabilities may exist.\u00a0</em></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HSE98NSDH7X8RDAFY9MDEAGZ'>Can I run the MSA multiple times?</h3>\n<p><em>You may run the MSA as many times as you wish.</em></p>\n<h3 id='h_01HSE98NSD07W57Y9SKMVECDDS'>Are my results shared with KnowBe4?</h3>\n<p><em>Your results are completely private.

When you report a non-simulated email with the Phish Alert Button (PAB), a copy is forwarded to your admins for review in their PhishER console.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PhishER/PER_Discussion_Email.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PhishER/PER_Discussion_Email.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p>Once your admin reviews the reported email, they may send you a message like the one displayed above. Any responses you send to these emails are sent back to your PhishER admins for review and are treated like direct messages so that they can respond in real time!</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns, contact your internal IT team or our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/requests/new'>support team</a>.</p>",

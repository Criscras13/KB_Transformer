This issue could be a variety of reasons, such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We encourage you to consider whether these senders are using RTF instead of the default HTML formatting. This action can be done on a per-recipient basis.</li>\n<li>Changing an attribute in the actual contact on the Global Address List may resolve the issue.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01JR8T1KFC7TZJ41XENR9V7411'>Microsoft Exchange 2007/2010</h3>\n<p>To change an attribute in Microsoft Exchange 2007/2010, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run the Exchange System Manager program.</li>\n<li>In the left panel, navigate to <strong>Global Settings</strong> <strong>Internet Message Formats</strong> <strong>Standard</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the context menu, choose <strong>Properties</strong> and navigate to the <strong>Advanced tab</strong>.</li>\n<li>Set the Exchange rich-text format option to <strong>Never use</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01JR8T1KFCR5CH50PK87X68CXX'>Microsoft Exchange 2013</h3>\n<p>To change an attribute in Microsoft Exchange 2013, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Exchange Management Shell.</li>\n<li>\n<p>To see your current settings, run the following command:</p>\n<div class='code-block'>\n<button class='copy-btn' data-target='text1'> Copy </button>\n<div id='text1'>\n<pre>Get-RemoteDomain | Where {$_.TNEFEnabled -ne $false}</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For each Remote domain, run the following command:</p>\n<div class='code-block'>\n<button class='copy-btn' data-target='text2'> Copy </button>\n<div id='text2'>\n<pre>Set-RemoteDomain -Identity DomainName -TNEFEnabled $false</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>",

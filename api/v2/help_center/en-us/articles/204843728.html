For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645138-Whitelist-data-and-anti-spam-filtering-information'>Whitelisting Guide</a>. Also consider that your mail server or mail filter may have rate limiting in place. This rate limiting could prevent a large number of emails from being delivered at once, and settings might need to be adjusted.</div>\n</div>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your free KnowBe4 account.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Free Phishing Security Test</strong>, click the <strong>Get Started</strong> button to begin. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/05_welcomepage.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/05_welcomepage.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>Select your industry and company size. Entering this data will allow you to compare your phishing test results to others in your industry. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/industry.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/industry.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>Choose what style of phishing template to use. We have five options: A basic Password Change request, an IT department request to sign a new email security policy using Adobe Acrobat Sign, and then three variations of the Password Change request template which match Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), Google Workspace (formerly GSuite), and Microsoft Exchange mail environments. You can also choose the language that you want to send the template in by clicking the language drop-down option. By default, the displayed templates will show in English. However, once a language has been selected, the templates will preview and send in the selected language. We recommend choosing a template that matches your email environment for the best results. If you're unsure of which template to choose, select the basic template.<br><br>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong><span>You can preview each template and send a test template email to yourself by clicking the <strong>Preview &amp; Send Test Email</strong>button. You can toggle the red flags on and off, preview the landing page, and send yourself a test email by clicking the <strong>Send Me a Test Email</strong> button in the top-right corner of the pop-up window. </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/07_choosetemplate.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/07_choosetemplate.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>Choose who you'd like to send this phishing test to. This page allows you to import up to 100 email addresses from your organization. To add these, simply type out or paste the email addresses into the box, one per line, with no commas or spaces. Click <strong>Next</strong> to move to the next step. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/08_recipients.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/08_recipients.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>Choose which landing page you would like your users to see upon failing the test. You can select either a 404 error page, so the user may assume they clicked on a broken link, or our Social Engineering Indicators (SEI) landing page, which lets the user know they failed a phishing test and then instructs them on the red flags that they should have looked out for on this particular phishing email. If you skip this step, we will select the SEI landing page by default. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/09_landingpage.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/09_landingpage.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>If you haven't already done so, make sure you whitelist our mail servers and test that you can successfully receive our phishing emails. On our <strong>Review &amp; Launch</strong> page, we provide links to our whitelisting documentation to guide you through this.<a href='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/10_whitelist.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/10_whitelist.png'></a>\n</li>\n<li>After whitelisting, click the gray <strong>Preview &amp; Send Test</strong> <strong>Email</strong> button. This is a sample of what your email will look like when your users receive it. You can toggle the red flags on and off, preview the landing page, and send yourself a test email by clicking the <strong>Send Me a Test Email</strong> button in the top-right corner of the pop-up window. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='http://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/11_preview.png'><img src='http://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/11_preview.png' alt=' '></a>\n</li>\n<li>After sending the test email, check your mail and make sure you've received it. This may take up to ten minutes to receive. You can make sure it has been delivered by checking the <strong>Test Email Delivery</strong> area towards the bottom of the page. If you receive this email, you are ready to continue to the last step. If you do not receive the email or it is filtered by your email system, please review our whitelisting instructions linked on the page, or you can view our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645138-Whitelist-data-and-anti-spam-filtering-information'>Whitelisting Guide</a>. Be sure to consider any spam filter service or device you have in place where we may need to be whitelisted as well. You can also <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/support' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>contact our support team</a> for assistance.</li>\n<li>Once you've successfully whitelisted and are ready to start your test, click the <strong>Start your free PST now!</strong> button to begin. The test will send out a phishing email to all of the users you have entered and it will track any clicks on these emails for three days.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01HGXV27J5Y7A3QG5YFHRH7ZCV'>Analyzing Your Results</h2>\n<p>After you run the test, you can return to your account at any time to view the results on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> page. You will be able to see your <strong>Phish-Prone Percentage</strong>, showing your vulnerability if a similar phishing attack were to occur within your organization. You will also see how your <strong>Phish-Prone Percentage</strong> compares with others in your industry, after one year of combined computer-based security awareness training and simulated phishing.<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='http://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/13_results.png'><img src='http://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Free_PST_Quickstart/13_results.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>A PDF report will also be emailed to you automatically after 24 hours. If you would like to know who clicked, your rep or reseller can get you that information! If you do not know who your rep is, simply <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/support' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>submit a support ticket</a> and we'll assist you right away.</p>\n<p>Armed with this knowledge, you can help protect your organization by teaching your users about the dangers of these types of attacks.

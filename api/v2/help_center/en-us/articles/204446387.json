When your users click a link in a phishing test, they will be redirected to a landing page with a data entry form. If your users enter data onto the form and submit it, their action will be considered a failure.</p>\n<p>You can also add a secondary landing page that your user will see if they fail the test. This secondary landing page can inform the user that they failed the test and provide the user with tips on how to stay safe from future attacks. After your users have completed the test, you will be able to review their results in a report.</p>\n<div class='callout-warning'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong>We don't record any data that your users enter onto the landing page.

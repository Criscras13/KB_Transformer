    "body": "<p>The User Event application programming interface (User Event API) allows you to import your users' security-related events or training activities from external sources and push them into your KSAT console. Once imported, any of your custom events will appear on the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360009588974.html'>Events Timeline</a> of affected users and may impact users' personal Risk Score.</p>\n<p>For full details about the User Event API, as well as sample requests, visit our <a href='https://developer.knowbe4.com/rest/userEvents' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>User Event API developer documentation</a>. If you decide to use KnowBe4's User Event API, review the sections below to see how you can manage your API usage and how custom events can strengthen your security awareness training.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong> A Platinum/Diamond subscription level is required for access to the User Event API Management Console.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01GQJR41SG8VGSCYB5ZZ58PH6Q'>User Event API Management Console</h2>\n<p>The User Event API management console is a central location for you to monitor, create, and track the usage of any of your User Event API keys. You can access the management console from the <strong>Account Integrations</strong> section of your KSAT <strong><a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/226457887.html'>Account Settings</a></strong> page. The management console is divided into three main tabs: <strong>Call History</strong>, <strong>Stats</strong>, and <strong>API Key</strong>. For more information about each tab, see below:</p>\n<div class='js-tabs'>\n<div title='Call History'>\n<p>The <strong>Call History</strong> tab will display a table of all of the API calls that were processed using your KSAT console.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Status ID</th>\n<th scope='col'>API Key</th>\n<th scope='col'>Events Created</th>\n<th scope='col'>Errors</th>\n<th scope='col'>Date Processed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A unique identifier generated for each API call.</td>\n<td>The name of the API key used to make the API call.</td>\n<td>The number of user events created as a result of the API call.</td>\n<td>All of the errors received during the API call.</td>\n<td>The date and time the API request was processed.Format:mm/dd/yyyy, h:mm a</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div title='Stats'>\n<p>Visit the <strong>Stats</strong> tab to monitor your monthly and annual API usage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Monthly Quota</strong>: This progress circle chart shows your monthly API usage. The chart shows the percentage of API calls made in relation to the number of API calls allowed. You are allowed 10 calls per seat per day each month.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Annual Quota</strong>: This bar graph shows your annual API usage. The data is broken down by your monthly quota for each month over a 12-month time period.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div title='API Key'>\n<p>Use the <strong>API Key</strong> tab to create one or more API keys. Your API key will be used to authenticate your KSAT console when making an API call or request. To create an API key, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> field, enter a unique name for your API key. If you plan on creating multiple API keys, we recommend using a meaningful name to best reflect the intended use of the key.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Create API Key</strong> button. The <strong>User Events API Token</strong> pop-up window will open.</li>\n<li>Click the User Events API token to copy the token. Make sure to save your copied API token somewhere that you can easily access. After you close this window, you will not be able to view this token again.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Repeat the steps above to create as many API keys as you would like. Once created, any of your API keys will be listed in a table under the <strong>API Key</strong> tab.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Key</th>\n<th scope='col'>Name</th>\n<th scope='col'>Actions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A unique identifier used to authenticate an API request associated with your KSAT console.

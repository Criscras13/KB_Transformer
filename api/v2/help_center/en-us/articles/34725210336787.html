    "body": "<p>You can integrate your <a href='https://www.harmonic.security/'>Harmonic Security</a> platform into your KSAT console, allowing new workflows for security awareness training. The result is more intuitive training based on users\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p>Harmonic Security allows you to insert Harmonic alert data into a webhook endpoint, whether that be SIEM, SOAR, or other ingestion tools. For example, you can use <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403664433683-Integrate-Tines-with-PhishER'>Tines\u2019 webhooks</a> to build workflows that allow users to resolve their own security issues in Harmonic Security\u2019s user intervention features.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JAZCGMN2BRCBQFSQQXZJD6MY'>Before You Integrate Harmonic Security with KSAT</h2>\n<p>Before you integrate Harmonic Security with your KSAT console, you need to ensure that KSAT is configured correctly and that you\u2019ve created a Harmonic Protect custom event by setting up a <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/8354913796115-Smart-Groups-Overview'>Smart Group</a>. This will trigger events in KSAT based on an alert from Harmonic Security\u2019s platform.</p>\n<p>You can use <a href='https://developer.knowbe4.com/events/#tag/Event-Types/paths/~1event_types/post'>KnowBe4's User Event API</a> to configure your custom event by following the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make a <a href='https://developer.knowbe4.com/rest/userEvents#tag/Event-Types/paths/~1event_types/post'>POST request</a> using the .txt file below.\u00a0\n<div class='code-block'>\n<div></div>\n<div><button class='copy-btn' data-target='text1'>Copy </button></div>\n<div id='text1'>\n<pre>{\n\"name\": \"Harmonic Data Protection\",\n\"description\": \"Track a user's involvement in a Data Protection alert.

To create a workflow, follow the steps below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to the Harmonic Security portal, and click on the <strong>Integrations</strong> tab at the bottom left corner of the page.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Webhooks</strong>. <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/integrations/HarmonicIntegrationsWebhooks.png'>\n</li>\n<li>Using <a href='https://www.tines.com/'>Tines</a>, select the webhook input, <a href='https://www.tines.com/library/stories/1256315/?name=notify-and-assign-training-based-on-harmonic-security-alerts&amp;redirected-from=%2Flibrary%2Fstories%2F'>copy the URL from a Tines story</a> into Harmonic Security\u2019s webhook integration, and subscribe to all alerts. <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/integrations/HarmonicTinesWebhook.png'>\n</li>\n<li>Store the alert data, including <strong>Username, Email, Alert Timestamp,</strong> and the <strong>Alert ID,</strong> in a database. Harmonic Security recommends using <a href='https://www.notion.so/product'>Notion\u2019s</a> database features, but you may use any database you like.</li>\n<li>You can query the database to see how many times a user has triggered an alert in a specific timeframe, such as 24 hours.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If you are unable to find an appropriate template in the Tines Story Library, you can use the <a href='https://www.tines.com/docs/actions/shortcuts/'>cURL command</a> listed below.

Brief and targeted mandatory training will also be assigned to users after three security alerts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a user receives their first security alert, the SecOps team will receive a notification in their Slack channel.</li>\n<li>If the alert is triggered a second time, the user will receive a message from Harmonic\u2019s data protection virtual expert, Maestro, in Slack with more detailed information on what occurred and how to better protect organization data. </li>\n<li>If an alert is triggered a third time, the user will be assigned mandatory security awareness training. This training is assigned to the Smart Group created for Harmonic Security events.</li>\n</ul>",

You can set up SecurityCoach integrations with Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Chat to be used as delivery methods for SecurityTips. Since SecurityCoach is a product within the KSAT console, you can use these same integrations to send your users notifications about their assigned training.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>You must first set up your delivery methods in SecurityCoach to send training notifications via Slack and Microsoft Teams. To learn how to set up these delivery methods see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/7157787612819.html'>Slack Integration Guide</a>, <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/7157869422099.html'>Microsoft Teams Integration Guide</a>, or <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/21452968565523.html'>Google Chat Integration Guide</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Once your SecurityCoach delivery methods have been set up, you can select the delivery method wherever you set up a training notification.

You also have the option to send <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/API_testing/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010848868.html'>manual notifications</a> from the campaign <strong>Overview</strong> or <strong>Users</strong> subtabs.

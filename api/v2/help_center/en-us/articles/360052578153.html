    "body": "<p>Whenever you have tasks to complete, tasks to approve, or other items to attend to in your KCM GRC platform, the system will automatically send you email notification reminders. In addition to individual notifications, if you are scheduled to receive more than one notification around the same time, the KCM GRC Email Digest combines your notifications into one email. This digest makes it so you'll receive a smaller number of notifications from your platform without missing important updates.</p>\n<p>KCM GRC's email notifications will either have a subject line that is specific to the purpose of the email, or the subject line will state \"KCM GRC Email Digest\". All emails with the \"KCM GRC Email Digest\" subject line contain more than one notification.</p>\n<p>All emails that are generated from KCM GRC are sent from the kcm[at]knowbe4.com email address.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HVKP5CBVKNRG04HM3FKBP3C2'>When Will I Receive an Email Digest Instead of Individual Emails?</h2>\n<p>Whenever you are set to receive two or more notifications within five minutes of each other, the notifications will be combined into one email digest.</p>\n<p>This means, every time an email is triggered for you, KCM GRC queues the email for approximately five minutes and waits to see if you will receive an additional notification.

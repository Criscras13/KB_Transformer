We recommend using alternate file types when testing your users:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Mail Server</th>\n<th scope='col'>Type of Attachment Rejected</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Google Suite</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>All attachments with macros (.ppt, .xls, and .doc)</li>\n<li>.pdf attachments</li>\n<li>.xlsx attachments</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Microsoft 365</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>All attachments with macros (.ppt, .xls, .xlsx, and .doc)</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This list is <strong>not</strong> inclusive of all affected attachment types or mail servers and may change over time. Mail client and server rules change often, so your experience with attachment delivery may vary. If you would like to disable attachments with macros from being sent during a phishing campaign, you have the option to do so from the Phishing section of the <strong>Account Settings</strong> page.

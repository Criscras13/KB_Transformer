This feature includes sending emails on behalf of other users when the Microsoft Outlook Add-in is installed.</p>\n<p>When an email is sent from a shared mailbox, and the user triggers Prevent advice, we will continue to capture and display that event in the Prevent dashboard. Prevent admins will be able to search and view those emails sent from a shared mailbox as they would a regular email sent with Prevent advice.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JQ6VWANN57554TZG15YBF881'>Requirements</h2>\n<p>This feature is available to customers who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Microsoft 365</li>\n<li>Have ingested data into Prevent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These requirements allow advice for shared mailboxes to function while maintaining users' data security.</p>\n<p>This feature is automatically available to those who meet these requirements, and no action is needed.</p>",

Think of it as your blueprint for automation: you define who gets included, how often they receive phishing tests and training, then AIDA Orchestration handles the day-to-day execution.</p>\n<p>Each Plan includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>User groups</strong> you want to include and any you want to exclude</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Phishing</strong> <strong>or Training frequency</strong> limits for phishing tests and security awareness training</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01K7FE8EZZ2BV2CER6MXDVECSV'>Why use multiple Plans?</h3>\n<p>Different teams often need different approaches to security training. Plans let you customize AIDA Orchestration\u2019s automation for each group's needs.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K7FE8KJ14V5CG92GMQQEG0SG'>How Plans work together:</h3>\n<p>When you have multiple plans, they follow a priority order you set. If a user appears in multiple groups across different plans, AIDA Orchestration applies the plan with the highest precedence to that user.

This means that if you have NAA-SSO enabled for Hybrid PAB on your tenant, you don\u2019t need to authorize it for the Microsoft Ribbon PAB or other types of PAB. This is the same for SSO-OBO.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do I check for the Microsoft Graph API permissions used by the PAB?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Using your Microsoft Entra portal, you can check the PAB's Microsoft Graph API permissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Login to your Microsoft Entra admin center and navigate to <strong>Applications &gt; Enterprise Applications</strong>.</li>\n<li>Filter out the PAB by typing in \u2018phish alert\u2019 on the filter input box.</li>\n<li>Then click on the Phish Alert button entry and check the details related to the Phish Alert button.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What should I do if I enabled NAA-SSO, but the Hybrid PAB didn\u2019t work for my environment?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Check if the PAB permissions were accepted for NAA-SSO and Graph APIs for the PAB. The permissions table will look similar to this:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB/MSR/EN/Azure_Permissions.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB/MSR/EN/Azure_Permissions.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve confirmed that the permissions have been accepted and the issue still isn\u2019t resolved, contact our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/requests/new'>support team</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How long do the permissions take to update once accepted?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Permissions are updated almost instantly for browsers and new Outlook clients. However, for Windows Outlook clients, it might take some time to update. If you\u2019re using a Windows Outlook client and your permissions are taking a while to update, we suggest <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/clear-cache' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>deleting the WEF or cache folder of Windows Outlook</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Will our users notice any difference once we authorize NAA-SSO?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The only difference users will see is that it may say Graph in the top right corner after they click the PAB to report an email.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB/MSR/EN/GraphPAB_NAASSO.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB/MSR/EN/GraphPAB_NAASSO.png' alt=' '></a></p>",

If you are running a phishing campaign and see unusual results, you may be experiencing false clicks. When reviewing campaign results, if you see a 100 percent click rate or IP addresses that don't belong to your organization, this can indicate false positives. The <strong>False-Positive Phishing Evasion</strong> settings can minimize incidences of false positives, giving you more accurate phishing campaign results. For more information about bot clicks, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059091413-Identify-and-Address-False-Positives#h_01HBVJBX3Q8HQQHBG2TN86YJPR'><strong>How to Identify Bot Clicks</strong></a> section of our <strong><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059091413-Identify-and-Address-False-Positives'>Identify and Address False Positives</a></strong> article.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>False-Positive Phishing Evasion settings are not meant to replace proper whitelisting. These settings are meant to be used as a tool to help with false positives along with whitelisting. You still need to troubleshoot false positives to confirm proper whitelisting. For more information on setting up whitelisting in your KSAT console, please consult our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645138-Whitelisting-Guide'>Whitelisting Guide</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>False positives in phishing simulations often stem from improper whitelisting practices, link scanner interference, or incorrectly configured security policies. To minimize these issues, ensure your spam filters are properly set up to exclude KnowBe4 phishing emails from link scanning and probing activities.</p>\n<p>Verify that smart hosts and advanced delivery policies align with your campaign settings. When investigating false positives triggered by link scanners, review your whitelisting configurations and collaborate with IT admins to confirm that security settings meet organizational standards while reducing false-positive occurrences.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JFJKWPQCJ2N3C6H3QTM3NK9A'>Enabling False-Positive Phishing Evasion Settings</h2>\n<p>We refer to phishing failures not caused by a user clicking a phishing link as false positives. If not resolved, false positives can cause phishing campaign results in your <strong>Phishing Security Test Reports</strong> to be inaccurate.</p>\n<p>False-positive phishing evasion works by tracking when a hidden link in a sent Phishing Security Test (PST) is accessed. Phishing failures that occur after this hidden link is accessed are flagged and ignored if they occur within the configured <strong>Duration for Ignored Bot Failures</strong>. In addition, IP addresses for bot-associated failures and actual phishing test failures are compared by configuring the <strong>IP Address Match for Ignored Bot Failures</strong> setting.</p>\n<p>You can enable and customize the <strong>False-Positive Phishing Evasion</strong> settings in the <strong>Phishing</strong> section of <strong>Account Settings</strong>. See the below screenshots and list for more information about the settings in this section:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Ignore Bot-Associated Phishing Failures</strong>: Select this check box to ignore bot-associated phishing failures that occur soon after a hidden link is accessed. When this setting is enabled, the <strong>Duration for Ignored Bot Failures</strong> and <strong>IP Address Match for Ignored Bot Failures</strong> options will appear.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/False_Positives_AcctSettings1.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/False_Positives_AcctSettings1.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Duration for Ignored Bot Failures</strong>: Here, you can select the amount of time after a hidden link is accessed that subsequent bot-associated phishing failures are to be ignored. The selections available are <strong>Conservative (5 sec)</strong>, <strong>Balanced (10 sec)</strong>, and <strong>Inclusive (30 sec)</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>IP Address Match for Ignored Bot Failures</strong>: You can select match criteria to ignore bot-associated phishing failures based on the IP address of the hidden link being accessed compared to the IP address of potential bot-associated phishing failures. The selections are <strong>No Match</strong>, <strong>First Two Octets</strong>, and<strong> Exact Match</strong>. The <strong>First Two Octets</strong> option will match IP addresses based on their Class B network identifier. For example, if the IP address is 54.70.53.60, it will look for IP addresses within the 54.70.0.0/16 subnet.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FalsePositives_AccountSettings2.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FalsePositives_AccountSettings2.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01JFJM5G98XDGM394C142H04D7'>How to View Details of Ignored Bot-Associated Phishing Failures</h2>\n<p>After you have enabled the <strong>Ignore Bot-Associated Phishing Failures</strong> setting, ignored failures on your phishing tests can be viewed in the <strong>Users </strong>&gt;<strong> Ignored Failures</strong> page on your phishing campaigns.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The <strong>Ignored Failure</strong> tab will only show if there were failures ignored during the phishing campaign.</div>\n</div>\n<p>See the below screenshot and list for an explanation of the data located in this section:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FP_Ignored_Failure_Header_Annotated.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FP_Ignored_Failure_Header_Annotated.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Name and Email</strong>: This column displays the name and email address of the ignored bot-associated failure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Date and Time</strong>: This column displays the date and time of the ignored bot-associated failure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bot Event Interval</strong>: This column displays the amount of time in seconds after a hidden link was accessed that subsequent bot-associated phishing failures were ignored.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ignored Failure Type</strong>: This column displays the type of ignored bot-associated failure, in this case, \u201cClicked.\u201d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>IP Address</strong>: This column displays the IP address of the ignored bot-associated failure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Browser</strong>: This column displays the browser used by the bot-associated failure, such as Chrome.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Browser Version</strong>: This column displays the browser version used by the bot-associated failure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>OS</strong>: This column displays the operating system used for the bot-associated failure, such as Mac.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bot Events</strong>: This column displays the number of ignored failures for this user.

Higher speeds may be necessary for simultaneous multi-user access.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVMCX2R7P890ACD96J26QXW'>Training and Video Module Optimization</h2>\n<p>Our modules and videos are optimized for both high- and low-bandwidth environments using the two key approaches outlined below.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JEVMD2XVRVC1DYP3SPY5J31P'>Adaptive Resolutions</h3>\n<p>We offer four adaptive resolutions for our training and video modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>360p</li>\n<li>480p</li>\n<li>720p</li>\n<li>1080p</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For clarity, 480p is DVD quality, and 1080p is High-definition (HD) quality.</p>\n<p>The resolution used for the video is based on the connection speed the customer is using to access our platform. Once the connection speed is recognized, our system adapts and plays the content at that resolution. For example, if a user has a slow connection, 360p or 480p is used; if it's faster, 720p or 1080p is used. This feature allows the videos to play in the resolution needed, depending on the user\u2019s bandwidth.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JEVMDJ372BMEMDMR7NEF0HA0'>Segmented Video Delivery</h3>\n<p>Videos are divided into smaller segments for efficient streaming. This approach achieves the following goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loads videos in smaller chunks rather than as a whole file</li>\n<li>Improves streaming performance, similar to platforms like YouTube and Vimeo</li>\n<li>Allows for continuous loading of upcoming segments as the video plays</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two optimization techniques allow a seamless viewing experience across varying internet connection speeds.</p>",

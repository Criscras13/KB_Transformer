Think of this foundation like a house that can easily be expanded as needed. AIDA uses special programs called Anthropic Claude models for its main creative AI abilities. For other specific tasks, we use our own unique algorithms.</p><p>We teach our AI models using smart techniques, allowing them to learn from a few examples. This technique helps them to produce accurate and specific results.</p><p>We are committed to using AI responsibly. This commitment means we work hard to make sure our technology is fair and doesn't reflect human-like biases.</p><p>We use AI by carefully training our models and setting up safety measures. These safety measures act like guardrails to prevent the AI from making things up, sometimes called \"hallucinations\", or causing other mistakes. This measure ensures our AI tools are dependable and trustworthy.</p><p>Refer to the sections below to learn more about <a href='#h_01J29X7371VA5ZR3M3H7W334QV'>AIDA Template Generation</a>, <a href='#h_01J29X8BRZ9MJ36VWZ70Q55HY5'>AIDA Automated Training</a>, <a href='#h_01J29X8V4M9PEZM3BCYFZ8EXAN'>AIDA Policy Quizzes</a>, and <a href='#h_01J29X8XSX7JRT49R1C7CP6G62'>AIDA Knowledge Refreshers</a>.</p><div class='callout-tip'><div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>To view an AIDA product demo, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000937648.html'>KnowBe4 Product Demos</a> article.</div></div><h2 id='h_01J29X7371VA5ZR3M3H7W334QV'>AIDA Template Generation</h2><p>Use AIDA to create custom phishing and callback phishing templates on demand based on your specifications.

      "body": "<p>The purpose of this guide is to share the best practices learned from organizations using The Inside Man series holding group \u201cwatch together\u201d sessions. We will cover how best to present the episodes in an engaging format that makes the most out of employee\u2019s time. Note that because movie watching has generally declined in favor of streaming series, we do not recommend a full-length movie experience. While a movie-length group session might work in some instances (with tech teams who are already fans, for instance), the best and most effective way to engage the majority of learners is two to three episodes per event with time for interaction/discussion after each viewing.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01J0Y49FNPZE8FD6BMSSK3FKYS'>How to Create a Playlist of Episodes</h2>\n<p>You can download the episodes you want to play in sequential order from the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360001802428.html'>Modstore as MP4s</a> article. From there, you can use a media player such as VLC to create a playlist of the episodes you would like to include. You can then play the episodes in full screen as if they were a single file rather than having to download extremely large files. We recommend playing the highest quality video supported by your display device (we recommend the 1080p MP4 version).</p>\n<h2 id='h_01J0Y4AXWJJCD4ZHNJ1CA26ER7'>Preparation</h2>\n<p>While every organization is different, we recommend delivering this content in a fun way. Suggestions include: an after-work event, lunch &amp; learns, team socials, popcorn parties, or any kind of event with snacks. Groups of 15-30 are optimal for discussion but larger groups that are well facilitated can also be conducted with success.

During this 90-day period, the new user bias is applied. Any training completions and phishing test results are still recorded and factored into the user's overall risk profile. However, the impact of these positive actions may be less noticeable due to the applied bias.</p>\n<p>After 90 days, the new user bias is removed. Then, your organization\u2019s Risk Score will show the entirety of the user's performance, including all training completed and phishing test results from the past 90 days. Users who have completed training and performed well in phishing simulations during their first 90 days will see a more significant drop in their Risk Score once the new user bias is removed.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HZMJ5DZ4RHSWJVBMH03HGEQE'>Security Types</h2>\n<p>The Security Types widget shows how your Risk Score has changed for each security type. A green arrow indicates that your Risk Score decreased, a red arrow indicates that your Risk Score increased, and a gray line indicates that your Risk Score didn\u2019t change. You can click the arrow to view more details about each security type.

      "body": "<p>Google User Provisioning (GUP) is an automated method for importing users from your Google Workspace tenant directly into your KnowBe4 console. This integration allows you to use data from Google Workspace to provision users in your KnowBe4 console. Changes that you make to your users\u2019 information and statuses in Google Workspace will sync automatically to your KnowBe4 console. Once you have configured the integration, you\u2019ll be able to manage all your users from one place.</p>\n<p>This integration requires you to have access to a Google super-admin account. The admin account must have the permissions to configure the six Google scopes that are required by this integration. For the full list of required scopes, see the <a href='#h_01HZHK4XWS273NA90MS3P8BVY2'>What You Will Need</a> section of this article. If you are not a Google customer, KnowBe4 also offers other methods of automated user provisioning. For further information about alternative user provisioning methods, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360052380374.html'>SCIM Configuration Guide</a> or our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228373888.html'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HZHK0BFY6VVBX05GSMTJ7ZP4'>How GUP Works</h2>\n<p>Using your Google <strong>Customer ID</strong> and your KnowBe4 <strong>Client ID</strong>, you can configure a direct connection between your Google Workspace environment and your KnowBe4 console. Once this connection has been established, you can configure which of your Google Workspace users and groups you would like to sync into your KnowBe4 console. Changes that you make to your users in Google Workspace will be reflected automatically in your KnowBe4 console.</p>\n<p>This sync is an automated process that occurs repeatedly throughout the day. Syncs will occur every six hours at minimum. The sync is a one-way process, and any changes made to users in your KnowBe4 console will not sync to your Google Workspace environment. Changes made to users directly in your KnowBe4 console will be overwritten by the data in Google Workspace. Any users in your KnowBe4 console who are not present in Google Workspace will be archived during the next GUP sync.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout_content'>\n<strong>Note: </strong> You have the option to prevent any specific users from being managed by GUP. To prevent specific users from being managed by GUP, create a CSV file with a list of users that you don\u2019t want to be managed by GUP. Enter \u201cfalse\u201d under the <strong>Provisioning Managed</strong> heading for those users.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HZHK1SW9Z685B81GY3M1R0H0'>Prerequisites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You must have admin access to your organization's KnowBe4 console.</li>\n<li>You must have super-admin access to Google Workspace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01HZHK45DHHA6N5PA6GTGZ3D9H'>Configuring Your Google Workspace Connection</h2>\n<p>In order to configure GUP, you\u2019ll need to connect your KnowBe4 console to your Google Workspace tenant.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HZHK4XWS273NA90MS3P8BVY2'>What You Will Need</h3>\n<p>You will need to gather the KnowBe4 <strong>Client ID</strong> and list of six scopes from your KnowBe4 <strong>Account Settings</strong> in order to complete the connection to Google Workspace.

This vulnerability allows a regular user to modify the application's configuration file to redirect update checks to an arbitrary server, which can then be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2024-29209 to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.</p>\n<p>The issue stems from improper permission settings on the application's configuration file, which is stored in a common directory accessible to all users. This file includes critical parameters, such as the update server URL. By default, the application does not enforce adequate access controls on this file, allowing non-privileged users to modify it without administrative consent.</p>\n<p>An attacker with regular user access can alter the update server URL specified in the configuration file to point to a malicious server. When the application performs its next update check, it will contact the attacker-controlled server. If the system is also vulnerable to CVE-2024-29209, the attacker can deliver a malicious update package that, when executed, grants them elevated privileges.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HWTBT5QCR0XZJYQM9J692T9A'>Impact</h2>\n<p>This vulnerability can lead to a regular user executing code with administrative privileges.

The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to securely verify the authenticity and integrity of the update server.</p>\n<p>The application periodically checks for updates by querying a specific URL. However, this process does not enforce strict SSL/TLS verification, nor does it validate the digital signature of the received update files. An attacker with the capability to perform DNS spoofing can exploit this weakness. By manipulating DNS responses, the attacker can redirect the application's update requests to a malicious server under their control.</p>\n<p>Once the application queries the spoofed update URL, the malicious server can respond with a crafted update package. Since the application fails to properly verify the authenticity of the update file, it will accept and execute the package, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host machine.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HWTBKDKDJPP4V47DF3EJ6566'>Impact</h2>\n<p>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code with elevated privileges, potentially leading to data theft, installation of further malware, or other malicious activities on the host system.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HWTBKMX7TAQA3WC9AM3AV271'>Affected Products</h2>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Phish Alert Button (PAB) for Outlook EXE versions 1.10.0-1.10.11</li>\n<li>Second Chance Client versions 2.0.0-2.0.9</li>\n<li>PIQ Client versions 1.0.0-1.0.15</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01HWTBKYYJBMKV50W2H7AN34GD'>Remediation</h2>\n<p>Automated updates will be pushed to address this issue.

If you would like to automate your simulated phishing tests <em>and</em> remedial training enrollments, we suggest following the plan outlined in this article instead: <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/8355418347667.html'>Smart Groups Phishing Automation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>For general and additional information about Smart Groups, please see the <a href='#ADDITIONAL'>Additional Smart Group Resources</a> section.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HKDSSH5E5M9GS442EKT7NTB0'>Before You Begin</h2>\n<p>To build this automated remedial training plan, you'll create several Smart Groups and training campaigns. The progression of this plan depends on two user events:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>The user has completed their previous remedial training assignment</li>\n<li>The user failed a phishing test after completing their previous remedial training assignment(s)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before you can create the necessary Smart Groups, you must decide what training content you'd like to assign for each round of remedial training. From your account, browse the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115001221467.html'>ModStore</a>, or refer to your <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010358067.html'>Automated Security Awareness Program (ASAP)</a> to decide which training assignments you'd like to assign.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong> If <strong>Optional Learning</strong> is enabled for your account, remedial Smart Groups may be impacted. If a user completes the training content selected a Smart Group's criteria, they will not be added to the Smart Group. This scenario is unlikely but possible.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HKDSSH5EVKQTCCZDNCRGTSPH'>Step One: Create a Smart Group for Each Round of Remedial Training</h2>\n<p>Begin by creating a Smart Group for each round of remedial training you'd like users to be enrolled in when they fail additional phishing tests. Follow this section to add the appropriate criteria rules to each of your remedial training Smart Groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Remedial Training - Round 1</strong></p>\n<p>Name the first remedial training Smart Group something descriptive of its purpose, such as \u201cRemedial Training - Round 1\u201d.</p>\n<p>Add the following criteria for this Smart Group:</p>\n<table style='table-layout: auto;'>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='row'>Phish Event</th>\n<td>User <strong>must</strong> have had <strong>any failures more than 0</strong> time <strong>on or after XX/XX/XXXX</strong>*</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope='row'>Training</th>\n<td>User <strong>has not completed [insert \"round 1\" remedial training assignment(s) here] ever</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>*If your organization is new to the KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training platform</strong>, insert the end date of your <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010347968.html'>baseline phishing campaign</a>, here. <strong>If your organization currently has phishing tests in place</strong>, insert the date in which you plan to launch this remedial training plan, here.</p>\n<p>This set of criteria creates parameters for all users who have failed a phishing security test after the baseline (or other) phishing test, and have never completed the specified training assignment.</p>\n<p>As one of our best practices for implementing the KnowBe4 platform, we suggest conducting a blind baseline phishing test to determine your organization's Phish-prone percentage. In the <strong>Phish Event</strong> criteria rule, by specifying any failures <em>after</em> the baseline test, you're omitting failures that may have taken place before users had taken any\u00a0security awareness training. See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/225574347.html'>Best Practices Guide</a> to learn more about integrating KnowBe4 into your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Remedial Training - Round 2</strong></p>\n<p>Now, set up the second Smart Group for the users who have had an additional failure on a phishing security test <em>after</em> completing the first round of remedial training.</p>\n<p>Give the second remedial training Smart Group a descriptive name, such as \u201cRemedial Training - Round 2.\u201d</p>\n<p>Add the following criteria for this Smart Group:</p>\n<table style='table-layout: auto;'>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='row'>After Training</th>\n<td>User <strong>must</strong> have had <strong>any failures</strong> after completing: <strong>[insert \"round 1\" training assignment(s) here]</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope='row'>Training:</th>\n<td>User <strong>has not completed [insert \"round 2\" training assignment(s) here] ever**</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>**</strong>Or, use \"on or after XX/XX/XXXX\" (the date you entered for the \"Remedial Training - Round 1\" Smart Group, as explained <a href='#h_01HKDSSH5EVKQTCCZDNCRGTSPH'>above</a>).</p>\n<p>This criteria set creates parameters for users who failed a phishing test again, after taking the first round of remedial training.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Training</strong> criteria rule takes into consideration that users have not completed the assignment(s) included in the second round of remedial training. It is important to include the <strong>Training</strong> rule because this parameter will automatically remove users from this Smart Group once they complete their second round of remedial training.</p>\n<p><strong>Remedial Training - Round 3, 4, etc.</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow can be continued to create as many remedial training Smart Groups as you feel necessary.</p>\n<p>When deciding how many additional groups you should create, consider the following:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>How frequently you're phishing your users</li>\n<li>How often you'd like to re-evaluate the content you're assigning, to replace it with new content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Refer to the table below to create additional remedial training Smart Groups.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HVRR1QV0JMDDAJ8TWGKXTMT2'>Smart Group Remedial Training</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Remedial Training Campaign Title</th>\n<th scope='col'>Smart Group Title</th>\n<th scope='col'>Smart Group Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 1</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 1</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Phish Event:</strong> User must have had any failures more than 0 time on or after XX/XX/XXXX*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-neutral-5);'>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 1\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 2</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 2</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);'>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing: [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 1\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 2\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 3</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 3</td>\n<td>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 2\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-neutral-5);'>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 3\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 4</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 4</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);'>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 3\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 4\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 5</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 5</td>\n<td>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 4\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-neutral-5);'>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 5\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Round 6</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);' rowspan='2'>Remedial Training- Round 6</td>\n<td style='background-color: var(--clr-white);'>\n<strong>After Training:</strong> User must have had any failures after completing [insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 5\u201d campaign]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Training:</strong> User has not completed all of [insert \"Remedial Round 6\" training assignment(s)] ever**</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>*If your organization is new to the KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training platform,</strong> insert the end date of your <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/115010347968.html'>baseline phishing campaign</a>, here. <strong>If your organization currently has phishing tests in place, </strong>insert the date in which you plan to launch this remedial training plan, here.** Or, use \"on or after XX/XX/XXXX\" (the date you entered for the \"Remedial Training -

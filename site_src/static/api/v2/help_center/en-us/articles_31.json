      "body": "<p>During a phishing campaign, your users will receive Phishing Security Tests (PST). Based on if they fail or pass the phishing security test, they will receive a Phish-prone Percentage. Users with a low Phish-prone Percentage are less likely to fall for real phishing attacks than those with a higher Phish-prone Percentage. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about PST, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/236271227.html'>What is a Phishing Security Test (PST) and How Does it Work? </a>article.</p>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8F8Z5PHZMY2HFW0ACGAGWQM'>What Is a Failure?</h2>\n<p>If a user interacts with the email in an unsafe way, that action is a failure and the user fails that test. Users can have multiple failures from a PST during a phishing campaign. In order from most to least severe, the different types of failures are listed below:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Entering data on a landing page</li>\n<li>Entering personal information in a callback phishing call</li>\n<li>Enabling a macro on an attachment</li>\n<li>Replying to the simulated phishing email</li>\n<li>Opening an attachment</li>\n<li>Scanning a QR Code</li>\n<li>Calling the number and entering the callback code in a callback phishing email</li>\n<li>Clicking the embedded link</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8F8Z5PHKKJ5AR5FXXNTY914'>How Phish-prone Percentage Is Calculated</h2>\n<p>A Phish-prone Percentage is the percentage of employees that are prone to click on a phishing link. It differs from a <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360018819194.html'>Phish-failure Percentage</a> since it tracks the exact way a user fails. It is possible for a user to have many failures on one email and receive a Phish-prone Percentage that goes over 100 percent. For example, if a user opens an email, clicks on the link, and opens the attachment, they have two failures and one failed phishing test. As a result, this user will have a 200 percent personal Phish-prone Percentage, because the user failed two times in one test.</p>\n<p>A higher personal Phish-prone Percentage indicates that the individual user may be more vulnerable to an email-borne social engineering attack. If a user opens a simulated phishing email and has many failures, then they are failing to spot red flags. Knowing the number and types of failures can help determine what training the user needs.</p>\n<h2 id='iv_01H8F8Z5PHDC77ABGRFQAFA4ZE'>Campaign Phish-prone Percentage</h2>\n<p>A phishing campaign creates a Phish-prone Percentage from the number of total failures divided by the total number of emails delivered in that campaign.</p>\n<p>If 100 people received emails, and 52 of them clicked a link in the email that would mean 52 percent of them failed. If eight of those 52 people also entered data into the landing page, that would increase the Phish-prone Percentage for that campaign to 60 percent.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In May of 2022, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s National Assembly passed Bill 96 to promote the use of the French language in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec. Taking effect in June 2023, the law requires, among other things, that all policies and training materials assigned to employees within the province be provided in the French language.\u00a0</p>\n<p>KnowBe4 recognizes the value of providing content in the language in which employees are most comfortable learning, not just in Canada, but throughout the world. To that end, we have supported Canadian French (Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois) as a major language for five years (See our\u00a0<a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/security-awareness-training-languages' target='_self'>Language Support List</a>) and we continue to provide materials in French where it is culturally appropriate. We also localized much of this content (by providing local voices and examples in Canadian French) where it makes sense to do so. At the time of this writing, there are 486 pieces of content in our ModStore available in French, and also 475 pieces of content that are localized in Canadian French.\u00a0</p>\n<p>End users may select their preferred language in our Learner Experience (LX), so we highly recommend offering these options when assigning any content to users in the region. While there are many pieces of training content that are dubbed with a French voice, some are only captioned based on the context of the training content. We are committed to working with local organizations to identify French content that would benefit from being fully localized.\u00a0 As an example of our commitment, we are continuing to dub seasons 3 through 5 of The Inside Man in French (in addition to seasons 1 and 2, which are already fully dubbed) and hope to have them available in time for cybersecurity awareness month (October 2023).\u00a0 We always welcome feedback, so if you believe a piece of training content requires translation or localization to meet the requirements of the bill, please feel free to reach out to us.\u00a0</p>\n<p>KnowBe4 is committed to providing the highest quality security awareness and compliance content in the world. Our global team is focused on providing local content options for all of our customers. Keeping Canadians safe from cybercrime, as well as compliant with laws and regulations, is an important mission of KnowBe4. We will continue adding more content to our library to meet the needs of our growing base of valued customers and partners.</p>\n",

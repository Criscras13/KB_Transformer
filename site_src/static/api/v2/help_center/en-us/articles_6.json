      "body": "\n<p>Several new mail flow rules are introduced during the deployment of Defend. You will need to consider how these may impact existing rules you have set up. Below are some of our recommended considerations.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JE6NZJA0HHVWGQA3BRXEC4G3'>Email Signature Software</h2>\n<p>If you currently use a third-party provider to apply signatures or disclaimers to your emails, such as Exclaimer or CodeTwo, then this software won\u2019t generally affect anything. All emails will be processed as they are today before Defend analyzes them. As a general rule, Defend processes emails after custom rules have been run.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JE6NZJA0VE978HMWHWG9BB4A'>External Tags</h2>\n<p>If you currently use a mail flow rule to add an External message or tag in the subject line or at the top of your email, this rule will need to be moved to run after Defend has finished processing. Eventually, Defend will replace the custom mail flow rule. However, during the learning phase, we need to move the rule to run after Defend to avoid duplicating the tags.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JE6NZJA0VN846FCBW8BZD1P6'>Non-Gateway IP Blocks</h2>\n<p>If you use an email gateway and your mail exchange (MX) records point anywhere other than Microsoft 365, then you may have a mail flow rule that blocks all emails that don\u2019t originate from your email gateway IP addresses. In this case, an exception will need to be made so you can accept emails from Defend.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JE6NZJA0HFVB70A7SERMYCDP'>Rule to Encrypt or Apply Rights Management</h2>\n<p>If you currently have a rule that automatically encrypts emails or applies restrictions to emails, then you will need to change the priority of the rules to run after Defend. This action will ensure Defend can always read or edit the message. For example, when replying to an email from outside your organization, we will remove all the Defend banners and rewritten links. This action is not possible if the email received is encrypted. The same encryptions and rights will be applied before the email is sent to the intended recipients.</p>",

This mode is typically used during a proof of concept (POC) or in the early stages of deployment while user communications are prepared.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVM84CK3F667RSR8BMJZRKN'>Banners</h2>\n<p>Banners are a core part of the Defend service. Contextual color-coded HTML warning banners are added to emails received, immediately alerting users to the level of risk of an email. In this mode, links are typically rewritten to provide time-of-click protection. Banners provide real-time teachable moments for your users, explaining aspects of an email that indicate a threat and augmenting your security awareness and training.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVM84CKDV0ZPTH6P543BHBJ'>Link Scanning and Rewriting</h2>\n<p>Defend features rewrite all URLs and scan links at the time of receipt and click. When scanning links, several checks are performed, including, but not limited to, blocklist checks, domain age, and number of redirects. The URL rewriting allows Defend to perform the checks again at the time of the click to protect against time-based attacks.</p>\n<p>The Defend URL rewriting feature can operate in conjunction with Microsoft SafeLinks. It cannot interoperate with other rewriting services from secure email gateways. This setting can be controlled via the Defend console <strong>Settings</strong> page.</p>\n<p><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Admin+Console/Defend+Link+Rewriting.png'></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVM84CKRM8EYSVMBQ0J1FHX'>Productivity Management</h2>\n<p>The Productivity Management feature encompasses graymail and spam detection and management to help users maintain clean, organized inboxes and focus on important communications.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K4WDDX6MW0QG8XDMND7TE6FP'>Graymail\u00a0</h3>\n<p>Graymail is a non-malicious bulk email sent from legitimate sources. Examples of graymail include opted-in newsletters, announcements, or advertisements. Defend features can detect graymail and action a graymail with the following functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Graymail banners</li>\n<li>Moving mail to a _Graymail folder</li>\n<li>Report as Graymail or not as Graymail buttons on email summary pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For full details, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/35666064197395.html'>Defend - Graymail Management</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K4WDEE0531VK8N5WG45WYGKB'>Spam</h3>\n<p>Spam is unsolicited bulk email, also known as junk email. It's any kind of unwanted and unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk. Spam is usually sent for commercial purposes and can be dangerous when it contains malicious links or attachments. Defend can detect and act on spam emails with the following functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spam banners</li>\n<li>Moving mail classified as spam to the Junk folder</li>\n<li>Report as spam or Report as not spam buttons on the email summary page</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For full details, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/37058465623443.html'>Defend - Spam Management</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVM84CKPVPCVA9Z6EZYZB0P'>Reporting</h2>\n<p>The Defend console provides detailed reporting and analytics. All incidents are tracked along with granular details about the attack, including the phish type, payload, sender IP address, location, and authentication results. The Defend console can be used to investigate incidents, and an investigation status and comments section are available. Alternatively, events can be exported to your own SIEM or SOC.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVM84CK7T701TKRGFJPX97E'>Remediation</h2>\n<p>Defend's email remediation controls, provided by Graph API, can be used to respond to threats quickly. In the case of a wider phishing attack sent to numerous internal recipients, Defend features can delete all identical or similar phishing emails.</p>\n<p>For full details, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/35666051020947.html'>Defend - How to Remediate Phishing Emails</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVM84CKVEG2J6FZAQVYNAFS'>Abuse Mailbox</h2>\n<p><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/egress/features_abuse_mailbox.png'>Usually, organizations have mailboxes that can be used to receive emails reported as phishing by end-users to be investigated. Defend features will monitor the specified abuse mailbox to see what is being reported by end-users and automatically remediate malicious and persistent phishing threats. Event notifications can also be configured to notify administrators when specific actions have occurred regarding the abuse mailbox.</p>\n<p>For full details, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/35666043364115.html'>Defend \u2013 Abuse Mailbox Automation</a> article.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Defend is an email security tool that evaluates your inbound emails' context, relationships, and message content. This analysis happens before the emails reach your inbox to prevent inbound cyber threats and allows your admins to identify and act on any future breaches.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note: </strong> The information contained in this guide is the default configuration of the Defend features. Your experience may vary depending on your organization's configuration choices.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01JEXRA1NNTX0K3FAK7VGHRJQT'>Banners</h2>\n<p>Incoming emails from outside of your organization will have a colored banner inserted. These banners inform you of how the email has been classified. The color of the banner corresponds to the associated level of threat.</p>\n<p>There are four banner categories displayed below:</p>\n<ul class='js-toggles'>\n<li title='Productivity Banners'>\n<p>Productivity banners are gray and are applied to emails that Defend classifies as graymail or spam. These emails are usually non-malicious bulk emails such as newsletters, announcements, or advertisements. The purpose of these banners is to act as a visual cue for easy categorization and improved productivity.</p>\n<p>An example of a productivity banner is displayed in the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Gray+banner.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Gray+banner.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li title='Benign Banners'>\n<p>Benign banners are blue and are informative alerts that are not associated with detected threats. These banners are designed to provide additional context about an email and typically do not require any specific action. Benign banners may notify you about various email characteristics, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sender: The email is from someone who has never emailed you before.</li>\n<li>Financial content: The email contains financial information or references.</li>\n<li>External source: The email originates from outside your organization.</li>\n<li>Sensitive information: The email includes content that may be considered sensitive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These banners increase awareness and help you make informed decisions about handling an email. While no immediate action is usually necessary, the information provided can be valuable for assessing the email's relevance and importance.</p>\n<p>An example of a benign banner is displayed in the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/External+Sender.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/External+Sender.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Blue+banner.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Blue+banner.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Sensitive+Information.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Sensitive+Information.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Financial+Banner.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Financial+Banner.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li title='Suspicious Banners'>\n<p>Suspicious banners are amber and are applied to emails that contain suspicious elements, potentially indicating phishing or impersonation attempts. These banners serve as a cautionary alert, prompting you to exercise increased vigilance. When you encounter an amber banner, follow the tips below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Exercise caution before taking any action on the email.</li>\n<li>Carefully inspect the sender's email address to verify its authenticity.</li>\n<li>Be wary of clicking on any links within the email.</li>\n<li>Avoid downloading or opening attachments unless you are certain of their safety.</li>\n<li>If you need to reply, double-check that you're sending to the legitimate sender, not a similar-looking fraudulent address.</li>\n<li>When in doubt, verify the email's legitimacy through an alternative communication channel, such as a phone call or in-person confirmation.</li>\n<li>Report suspicious emails to your IT or security team for further investigation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An example of a suspicious banner is displayed in the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Amber+banner.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Amber+banner.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Impersonation+Banner.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Impersonation+Banner.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li title='Dangerous Banners'>\n<p>Dangerous banners are red and are applied to emails exhibiting strong indicators of phishing or other malicious intent. These banners represent the highest level of threat warning. When you encounter a dangerous banner, follow the tips below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not click on any links or download any attachments within the email.</li>\n<li>Refrain from replying to the email or engaging with the sender.</li>\n<li>Do not forward the email to others, as this may spread the potential threat.</li>\n<li>Report the email immediately to your IT security team.</li>\n<li>Delete the email from your inbox after reporting it unless instructed otherwise by your IT team.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, dangerous banners indicate a severe risk, and treating these emails as genuine threats is important. Your organization's security protocols should always be followed when dealing with dangerous-bannered emails.</p>\n<p>An example of a dangerous banner is displayed in the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Red+banner.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Banners/Red+banner.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id='h_01K6DKFDKZXW9GV9HDKM4MPSRM'>Email Summary Page</h1>\n<p>All banners applied by Defend can be clicked on. This feature allows you to learn more about what was detected in the email. If you think an email has been categorized incorrectly, you can report it by selecting a reporting button at the bottom of the email summary page. For more information about what the email summary page displays, see the list below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Admin+Console/Email+Summary+Page.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Admin+Console/Email+Summary+Page.png' alt=''></a></p>\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>What we found</strong>: This section provides an overview of what Defend found and the recommended action you should take. In this example, Defend identifies strong signs of phishing and recommends following your organization's policy for reporting phishing emails.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Primary Reason</strong>: This area describes the primary reason the email raised concerns and triggered the banners.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Threat dial</strong>: The colored threat dial displays the risk rating that Defend has assigned to this email. In this example, Defend has assigned the highest risk classification.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Email information</strong>: This section displays advanced email information, including details such as the sender address, sender location, email security protocols, and your previous interaction history with the sender.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Report this email</strong>: The reporting section allows you to report the email if you believe it has been classified incorrectly by Defend.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01K6DKQ3HGAN5YJ44HJPS5W0M8'>Link Protection</h2>\n<p>Defend includes link protection that helps safeguard you from malicious links in emails, even when they appear legitimate. This protection works by checking links in your emails in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When an email arrives</li>\n<li>When you click on links in emails</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This dual approach helps protect you against links that may seem safe at first but later direct you to harmful websites. Attackers sometimes change where a link goes after an email is delivered, and Defend helps catch this trick by verifying links in real-time when you click them.</p>\n<p>When Defend detects a potentially harmful link that you've clicked, you'll see a warning screen instead of being taken directly to the website. This protective screen shows you the actual destination web address, indicates the specific signs of phishing that were detected, and highlights when the sender is being impersonated. This information helps you make an informed decision about whether it's safe to proceed to the website, protecting you from phishing attempts and other malicious sites that could compromise your security.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EM8d000006CN4s.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EM8d000006CN4s.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEXRA1NNME05QMNC4WQ1JJ0V'>Graymail Management</h2>\n<p>Graymail is a non-malicious bulk email that you may have previously opted-in to receive. Depending on your organization's configuration, emails flagged as graymail will either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appear in your inbox with a Graymail banner.</li>\n<li>Be sent to your _Graymail folder with a Graymail banner.</li>\n<li>Be sent to your Junk folder with a Graymail banner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can click on a Graymail banner to go to the email summary page, where you can find more information about the email.</p>\n<p>If you believe the email has been incorrectly flagged as graymail, or you want to receive graymail from this sender to your inbox, click the <strong>Report as not Graymail</strong> button. This action will ensure future emails of this kind will not be sent to your <strong>_Graymail</strong> folder.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Admin+Console/Graymail+Report.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Admin+Console/Graymail+Report.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01K30VXFW9JBYTBDBJV3DF25TR'>Languages</h2>\n<p>The default language for the Defend user experience is English.

To effectively understand how these systems interact, this article will walk you through the email filtering process.</p>\n<p>When an email is received by an organization using EOP, Defender, and Defend, the filtering process follows a specific sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Initial filtering by EOP and Microsoft Defender:</strong>\n<ol type='alpha'>\n<li>The first layer of defense involves filtering by EOP and Microsoft Defender. This step includes various security checks, such as spam filtering, malware scanning, and the application of any configured Microsoft 365 transport rules.</li>\n<li>It's important to note that even if an email triggers a transport rule designed to route the email through a specific connector. Instead, the remaining EOP or Microsoft Defender processing steps continue. A header to the email noting which connector should be used once further processing steps have been followed.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interaction with Defend:</strong>\n<ol type='alpha'>\n<li>Once the email has passed through all EOP or Microsoft Defender processing and has not been quarantined, it is routed to Defend. At this stage, Defend performs its analysis, including advanced threat protection and data loss prevention checks.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For organizations that have enabled Microsoft Defender, particularly the Safe Attachments feature, there is a specific interaction to be aware of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the initial pass through Microsoft Exchange, a transport rule called \"Defend disabled ATP dynamic scanning\" temporarily disables the dynamic scanning log for attachments.</li>\n<li>This action is necessary because the Safe Attachments feature may remove the attachment and place it in a sandbox for analysis, preventing Defend features from seeing the complete email.</li>\n<li>If Defend cannot analyze the full content, its detection capabilities are compromised.</li>\n<li>After the Defend console has completed its analysis and the email returns to Microsoft 365, dynamic scanning for the Safe attachments feature is still executed, for a second time, along with all other EOP or Microsoft Defender processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr0000052gDB.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr0000052gDB.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEXNMRXQB273KQ6JFQZJH7YP'>Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Microsoft Defender Online (MDO) with Defend\u00a0</h2>\n<p>All EOP or Microsoft Defender filtering happens before an email is routed to Defend.</p>\n<p>Transport rules are executed at the policy enforcement step. If the email triggers a transport rule that has an action to route out via a connector, Microsoft Exchange adds a header or property to the email to remember which connector should be used. It will then continue with processing the other steps. It does not send the email to Defend at this point.</p>\n<p>Once an email has gone through all EOP or Microsoft Defender processing, if it has not been quarantined, it will be routed to Defend.</p>\n<p>If you have Microsoft Defender enabled, specifically Safe Attachments functionality, there is a transport rule called \"Defend Disable ATP Dynamic Scanning\" that disables the dynamic attachment logic for all inbound emails on the first pass through Microsoft Exchange processing. This action is because the attachment can be removed and placed in a sandbox, which could result in Defend not seeing the complete email, which would hamper the detection.</p>\n<p>When the message returns to Microsoft 365 from Defend, the dynamic scanning for safe attachments is still executed, along with all other EOP or Microsoft Defender processing for a second time.</p>",

This action allows for more frequent testing of users where needed, driving better awareness and greater accuracy of the KSAT console's scoring features, such as Phish-prone Percentage and Risk Score.</p>\n<p>To configure this approach, we would recommend the following Smart Group criteria, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GPSb.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GPSb.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<p>This criterion ensures that users experiencing higher volumes of phish (suggested value of 12 per 30 days) are populated into the Smart Group.</p>\n<p>When creating a new phishing campaign, you can specifically target this Smart Group and choose your desired frequency, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GPsP.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GPsP.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVWHG527741ZF2W974V383J'>Disabling</h2>\n<p>The integration can be removed at any time within the Defend Security Center:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to the Defend Security Center.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Settings Partner Integrations</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Unlink KnowBe4</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GOGQ.jpg'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/egress/0EMSr000005GOGQ.jpg' alt=''> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEVWHG52071HDDK36R13KM6B'>FAQs</h2>\n<ul class='js-toggles' role='list'>\n<li title='I have completed the integration, but events are not displayed in the KnowBe4 User Timeline.'>It may take up to 24 hours before Defend events are available in the User Timeline.</li>\n<li title='I cannot find the KnowBe4 section within the Defend Partner Integrations Section'>You must have completed the Defend Azure AD Integration before the KnowBe4 integration will be displayed.</li>\n<li title='What data is shared with KnowBe4?'>\n<p>Enabling this integration shares very limited threat event details with the KnowBe4 platform.

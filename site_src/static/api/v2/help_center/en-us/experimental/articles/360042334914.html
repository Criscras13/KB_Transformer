As part of your risk management process, you can assign <strong>Likelihood </strong>and\u00a0<strong>Impact</strong> ratings to your risks. To assess your risks before and after risk treatment, you can assign <strong>Likelihood </strong>and <strong>Impact </strong>ratings before and after mapping controls. Based on the scores that you assign, your <strong>Inherent Risk Scores</strong> and <strong>Residual Risk Scores </strong>will calculate automatically to help you determine the severity of your risks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>See the following sections below to learn how to assign risk scores in your <strong>Risk Management</strong> module. <a name='LIKELIHOOD_IMPACT'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J8J4KVKXNMGG9HSEC1B9W0TR'>Likelihood and Impact Ratings</h2>\n<p>For a description of the <strong>Likelihood</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong> ratings and a score that is associated with each rating, see the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Likelihood</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Score</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Impact</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Score</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rare</td>\n<td>The chance of occurrence is less than 5%.</td>\n<td class=''>1\u00a0</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>If the risk occurred, it would cause a less than minor mission, system, or program degradation.\u00a0\u00a0</td>\n<td class=''>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unlikely</td>\n<td>The chance of occurrence is between 5% and 9%.</td>\n<td class=''>3</td>\n<td>Minor</td>\n<td>If the risk occurred, it would cause only a small cost and schedule increase.

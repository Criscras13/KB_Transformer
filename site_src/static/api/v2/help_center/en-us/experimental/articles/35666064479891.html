It may look like this SPF entry:</p>\n<pre>v=spf1 a include:spf.us1.defend.egress.com include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all</pre>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout_content'>\n<strong>Note: </strong> This is not essential and may not apply to you, but to confirm, you can check your record.</div>\n</div>\n<p>No changes are needed if your SPF record looks like the example above. This is because you are using the DNS hostname in your record, which w ill automatically pick up any additional IP addresses.</p>\n<p>However, if your SPF record explicitly lists individual Defend IP addresses, ensure you replace these with the relevant SPF hostname. An example SPF address with individual IP addresses might look like this:</p>\n<pre>v=spf1 a ip4:34.204.210.91 ip4:52.0.5.153 ip4:52.71.53.79 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all</pre>\n<h2 id='h_01JES7EPPJW1DHSDV66HN2E32W'>Custom Mail Flow Rules or Policies</h2>\n<p>If you have any custom Microsoft Exchange mail flow rules or policies that block or modify emails based on source IP addresses and the Defend IP addresses are explicitly stated in any of the rules, then changes to the Defend IP addresses will need to be reflected in any of the rules or policies in place.</p>",

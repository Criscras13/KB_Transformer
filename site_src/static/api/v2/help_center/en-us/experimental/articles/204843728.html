For more information, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/203645138.html'>Whitelisting Guide</a>. Also consider that your mail server or mail filter may have rate limiting in place.

We have five options: A basic Password Change request, an IT department request to sign a new email security policy using Adobe Acrobat Sign, and then three variations of the Password Change request template which match Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), Google Workspace (formerly GSuite), and Microsoft Exchange mail environments. You can also choose the language that you want to send the template in by clicking the language drop-down option. By default, the displayed templates will show in English. However, once a language has been selected, the templates will preview and send in the selected language. We recommend choosing a template that matches your email environment for the best results. If you're unsure of which template to choose, select the basic template.<br><br>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong><span>You can preview each template and send a test template email to yourself by clicking the <strong>Preview &amp; Send Test Email</strong>button.

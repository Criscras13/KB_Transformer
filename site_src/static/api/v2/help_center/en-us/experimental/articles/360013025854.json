The assigned tags trigger PhishER to run actions on the messages. You can create rules from the <strong>Rules</strong> tab.

Custom rules are rules that you can create by using the Yara Rule Editor. System rules are default rules provided by KnowBe4. The <strong>Rules</strong> tab also contains global variables, which are variables that you create to use in multiple rules with the same strings. By updating a global variable, you can update all of the rules that contain those strings.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>All PhishER rules must follow Yet Another Recursive/Ridiculous Acronym (YARA) rule logic to disposition messages.

  "body": "<p>After you integrate your KCM GRC platform with KnowBe4's Security Awareness Training (KSAT) console, you can create KCM GRC tasks to automate evidence collection from KSAT. Then, your users' training completions will automatically be used as evidence for the tasks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To learn how to create tasks for KSAT and work with integrated tasks, see the sections below. For general information about the KSAT integration, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/7728644706579.html' target='_self'>How to Integrate KnowBe4's KSAT Console with KCM GRC</a> article.</p>\n<p><a name='CREATING'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J8J034VGSGY9KNB85BGQT93M'>Creating Integrated Tasks</h2>\n<p>To create a KCM GRC task that collects evidence from KSAT, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KCM GRC platform.</li>\n<li>From your navigation panel, select the <strong>Controls</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> column, select the control that you would like to create a task for.</li>\n<li>On the <strong>View Control</strong> page that opens, scroll down to the <strong>Recurring Tasks</strong> subtab.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Create Task Schedule</strong>\u00a0button. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCM_Control_Tasks/KCM_Create+Task+Schedule+Button+2.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCM_Control_Tasks/KCM_Create+Task+Schedule+Button+2.png' alt='Create Task Schedule button PNG'></a>\n</li>\n<li>Next to <strong>Integration</strong>, select <strong>KnowBe4 KSAT Console</strong>.</li>\n<li>Fill out the rest of the fields on the\u00a0<strong>Create Task</strong> pop-up window.

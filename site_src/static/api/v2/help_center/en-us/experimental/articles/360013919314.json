      "alt": "This image displays the \"Reporting Emails\" configuration screen within the KnowBe4 PhishER administrative interface (indicated by product names like PhishER and PAB).\n\n**UI Structure and Navigation:**\n\n1.  **Primary Navigation (Left Panel):** A dark vertical sidebar features primary modules (e.g., Dashboard, Reports, PhishRiP). A gear icon (Settings) is selected at the bottom, directing the user to the secondary settings menu.\n2.  **Secondary Navigation (Settings Sidebar):** This pane lists settings categories, organized under headings: \"ACCOUNT,\" \"SECURITY ROLES,\" \"INTEGRATIONS,\" and \"KNOWBE4 LABS.\" \"Reporting Emails\" is highlighted, indicating the current view.\n3.  **Main Content Area:** Titled \"Reporting Emails.\" An orange-bordered button labeled \"Generate New Email\" is positioned in the top right.\n\n**Contextual Instructions (Warning Banner):**\n\nAn instructional banner with an orange background provides two main points:\n1.  It states the email address listed below is used to submit messages into PhishER, recommending the use of KnowBe4's Phish Alert Button (PAB) to ensure message headers are retained for analysis. It explicitly notes the address is *not* automatically added to PAB settings.\n2.  It suggests an alternative method of setting up an organizational email alias (e.g., `report-phish@organization.com`) and warns that forwarding emails via an alias may result in a loss of information, such as email headers.\n\n**Reporting Email Configuration Table:**\n\nA data grid lists configured reporting email addresses. The columns are:\n*   **Reporting Email:** (The actual email address is obscured.)\n*   **Active:** Displays a green toggle switch, indicating the single listed email is currently active.\n*   **Forwarded Only:** Displays an unchecked checkbox, indicating the email accepts direct submissions.\n*   **Actions:** Contains two icons: a Copy icon (likely to copy the email address) and a Trashcan icon (Delete function).",

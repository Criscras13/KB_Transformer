KnowBe4\u2019s Threat Research Lab team compiles data from all PhishER Blocklists and other sources to create Global Blocklist entries. These entries contain information that your mail server will use to filter unwanted emails.</p>\n<p>The Global Blocklist feature is only available for accounts with PhishER Plus. Once you enable this feature and connect it to your Microsoft 365 mail server, KnowBe4 will connect your mail server to the Global Blocklist.

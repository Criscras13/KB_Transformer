  "body": "<p>When you create a training campaign, you have the option to send an enrollment email automatically when the campaign starts. This email will provide your users with a link to confirm their account and log in for training.</p>\n<p>You can also send users a link to your KnowBe4 training login page. <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360043196354.html' target='_self'>KnowBe4's Training Instances</a> article for a full list of login links. However, the email address the user signs up with MUST match\u00a0the one that has been added to your account.</p>\n<p>Once the user signs up (or clicks the training link from their enrollment email for the first time) they will receive a confirmation email, which looks like the below:<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/quickstart_4_step_guide/ConfirmationEmail.png'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpimg/quickstart_4_step_guide/ConfirmationEmail.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n\n<p>They will need to click on the <strong>Activate my account</strong> link in the email to confirm their account. Then, they will be instructed to fill out some basic information. Following this, the user will be able to start their assigned training.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> If there are concerns with your users clicking links in emails, you can let them know to hover over the confirmation link to make sure it directs them to the official KnowBe4 URL.

This test will help you establish a baseline for your organization.</p>\n<p>The results of this baseline phishing test will show your organization's initial <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010178267-How-Is-Phish-prone-Percentage-Calculated-' target='_self'>Phish-prone Percentage</a>. The Phish-prone Percentage is the percentage of users who are likely to click on a phishing email. Consider this initial Phish-prone Percentage the baseline, or starting point, for your organization. Your organization's overall Phish-prone Percentage or Account Average Phish-prone Percentage is based on the Phish-prone Percentage of all users on your account, including those who have not received a Phishing Security Test (PST). As you conduct ongoing phishing tests, compare your organization's Phish-prone Percentage with the initial Phish-prone Percentage to measure the success of your security awareness training plan.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>Before you conduct your baseline test, please ensure you've whitelisted KnowBe4's IP addresses or domains in your email environment. Use our <a href='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/supporttools/whitelisting-wizard.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Whitelisting Wizard</a> or review our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645138' target='_self'>Whitelisting Guide</a> to learn the best method for whitelisting your email client and spam filters.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2KJ5WRGX246B4FRY3EZEX2'>Why Shouldn't I Announce the Test?</h2>\n<p>We recommend conducting an unannounced baseline phishing test in order to get the most accurate results. By not announcing the test, you can see how vulnerable your organization would be if a real phishing attack made it through your email filters. Having this insight can help you gain buy-in from your stakeholders. To learn more, please see: <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010148647' target='_self'>How Can I Engage My Stakeholders in My Security Awareness Training Plan?</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HH2KJ5WRRP3QKWWB6F8MBXBZ'>Recommended Settings for the Baseline Test Campaign</h2>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong>After you've whitelisted and before you create a baseline phishing campaign, we recommend running at least one test campaign that is limited to a small group of users. To learn more, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/206523288#PRELIMINARY' target='_self'>Preliminary Test Campaign</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/206523288' target='_self'>Quickstart Implementation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>To create your baseline campaign, go to <strong>Phishing</strong> &gt; <strong>+ Create Phishing Campaign</strong>. We recommend using the following settings for your baseline test campaign:</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> All phishing campaigns are localized by default.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Baseline_Phishing/BaselinePhishing_CampaignSettings1-6.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Baseline_Phishing/BaselinePhishing_CampaignSettings1-6.png' alt='An image of campaign settings 1-6.'></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Campaign Name: </strong>Name your campaign something descriptive, such as \"Baseline Test\".</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Send to:</strong> Select <strong>All Users</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Frequency:</strong> Select <strong>One-time</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Start Time:</strong> From the drop-down menus, select the desired date and time for your baseline test. The time you select should be during your organization's business hours as that is when your users are actively checking their emails.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sending Period: </strong>Select <strong>Send all emails when the campaign starts</strong>. When this setting is selected, emails will begin sending as soon as the campaign begins. The timing of sending and delivery will vary, depending on the number of users in the campaign. In most campaigns, all emails will be sent within an hour after the campaign starts..</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Track Activity: </strong>We recommend that you track phishing test failures for at least three days. For more information about sending and tracking periods, see our\u00a0<a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/217841868' target='_self'>How to Monitor and Review Phishing Campaigns</a>\u00a0article.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Track Replies to Phishing Emails: </strong>You can turn this setting on if you wish to track your users' replies to the phishing test emails.

To help with this confusion, we recommend that you send an email explaining what the phishing test was, and you can even share your organization's Phish-prone Percentage to emphasize the importance of security awareness training. We've provided a template that you can use for this email, please see: <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576987-What-Can-I-Send-to-My-Users-After-the-Baseline-Phishing-Test-Is-Completed-'>Template for After Your Baseline Phishing Test</a>.</p>\n<p>We recommend enrolling your users in security awareness training shortly after conducting your baseline phishing test.

  "body": "<p>Physical QR code phishing campaigns allow you to test how your users will react to finding an unexpected QR code. For example, if your users see a QR code on a poster in a familiar location, they may scan it and open the link without verifying that the link is secure. QR codes can contain data such as a link to a website, location, or digital business card. Malicious links hidden in QR codes may be able to bypass your organization's security filters.</p>\n<p>To train your users on QR code phishing attacks, you can create physical QR code phishing campaigns. These campaigns will allow you to download and print your own QR code posters to place in planned locations. Then, you can use your KSAT console to see if your users are scanning the QR codes.</p>\n<p>To learn how to create a QR code phishing campaign and then view your campaign results, see the sections below.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HQR2S6DSJH9WX0JBAWJPHJE1'>Creating the Campaign</h2>\n<p>To create a physical QR code phishing campaign, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT console.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Physical Tests</strong> &gt;\u00a0<strong>Physical QR Code</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Create New Physical QR Campaign</strong> button. \n<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Physical+Tests/Create+Physical+QR+Code+Campaign+button.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/Physical+Tests/Create+Physical+QR+Code+Campaign+button.png' alt='Create Physical QR Code Campaign button'></a>\n</li>\n<li>On the <strong>Create New Physical QR Campaign</strong> page, fill out the fields to customize your campaign.

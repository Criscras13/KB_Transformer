  "body": "<p>In this guide, you'll learn how to get started with Prevent, an AI-driven email security product designed to help you tackle outbound email risks. Prevent is a powerful cybersecurity tool that proactively identifies and mitigates outbound data risks by analyzing your outgoing communications. Prevent uses advanced AI to analyze emails in real time, focusing on sender behavior, content, and recipient to protect sensitive information from being inappropriately shared or exfiltrated. Prevent stops data breaches and incidents before they happen, supporting your organization\u2019s users in real time.</p>\n<p>To access the Prevent console, you must first use the deployment center to deploy Prevent for your organization. You can then use the Prevent console to customize data protection policies, alter Prevent configurations, and tailor the system to your organization and users. The Prevent dashboard provides you with an overview of the volume and nature of email events being analyzed and nudging your users, allowing you to conduct thorough investigations of potential data exposure incidents.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>To view a Prevent product demo, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000937648.html'>KnowBe4 Product Demos</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01K04RDZRTZPF21GPPPQVE6EXP'>Deployment Center</h2>\n<p>The Prevent deployment center is a comprehensive wizard that allows admins to configure and deploy Prevent to their organization easily. Admins are guided through each section of the deployment process, and progress is saved at every step. Once the deployment center is complete, admins gain access to the Prevent console, where further customization and product configuration can be completed.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01K04REVRHKJ8T714E575N9C84'>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To successfully complete the deployment center process, make sure you have the following prerequisites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft 365 tenant</li>\n<li>Global admin role on Microsoft 365 tenant</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01K04RGFJM1N0P8D41F1BE2BXC'>Deployment Center Steps</h3>\n<p>The following steps are completed in the deployment center:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Domains</strong>: Confirm all of your organization\u2019s internal domains that Prevent detects when syncing with Microsoft 365. This step is key to configuring Prevent optimally for your organization. For more information about the fields on the <strong>Domains</strong> page, see the list below.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Deployment+Center/Prevent+Domains.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Deployment+Center/Prevent+Domains.png' alt=''></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Primary Domain</strong>: Select the primary domain from your organization\u2019s Microsoft 365 tenant.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Internal Domains</strong>: Select all the internal domains that your organization owns and uses.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Groups</strong>: Confirm the two Microsoft 365 groups that will be used for ingesting historical email data and to identify which users to nudge with Prevent advice. For more information about the fields on the <strong>Groups</strong> page, see the list below.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The groups used for ingestion and nudging can be the same.

All users in this group will be provisioned, and their historical and email data will be ingested to Prevent.<strong><br></strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User Nudge Group</strong>: Specify the name of the group of users who will receive nudges from Prevent when an email they send has a risk associated with it.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>KnowBe4 Email Security Add-In</strong>: A critical part of the Prevent service is the KnowBe4 Email Security Outlook add-in. Download the installation file and upload it to your Microsoft 365 environment. This ensures that all users in your designated nudge group can access the add-in and receive real-time Prevent advice. For more information about the fields on the <strong>Add-In</strong> page, see the list below.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Deployment+Center/Prevent+Add-In.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prevent/Deployment+Center/Prevent+Add-In.png' alt=''></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Download Add-In Manifest</strong>: Select the Download Add-In Manifest button to download the manifest for the add-in. The add-in provides Prevent functionality to your users.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Email Nudges</strong>: In circumstances where real-time advice can be provided to users, Prevent will provide retrospective nudges. When an email is sent that triggers Prevent, the sender will receive an email from Prevent allowing them to continue or cancel the sending of their email. Specify the internal email address that Prevent should use to send retrospective nudges from, and the default action that should happen if a user doesn\u2019t reply to the nudge.

The dashboard is configured to show data for the \"Last 90 Days.\"\n\nThe layout consists of seven numbered widget panels detailing various endpoint security metrics:\n\n### 1. Endpoint Risk Overview (Key Performance Indicators)\nThis section presents four primary metrics:\n*   **Total Users with Events:** 39\n*   **Total Events:** 995\n*   **Threat Categories Found:** 5\n*   **Average Number of Threats per User:** 20\n\n### 2. Endpoint Threat Categories\nThis panel combines a donut chart visualization with a data table listing the top threat categories, event counts, and users involved. The top five entries are:\n| Threat Category | Event Count | Users Involved |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| attacker\\_methodology | 218 | 39 |\n| known\\_malware | 208 | 38 |\n| ransomware | 208 | 38 |\n| suspicious\\_activity | 185 | 38 |\n| ngav | 176 | 37 |\n\n### 3. Users with Endpoint Events\nA vertical bar chart illustrating user engagement based on the number of events recorded. The categories measured are: \"More than 0 Events,\" \"More than 1 Event,\" and \"More than 5 Events.\" All three categories show a user count close to 40.\n\n### 4. Endpoint Events Over Time\nA time-series line graph showing two data points from August 2022 through November 2022: \"Event Count\" and \"Users Involved.\" The Event Count line exhibits sporadic spikes, reaching a peak near 200 events towards the end of the timeline, while the Users Involved line remains consistently low.\n\n### 5. Endpoint Threat Distribution\nThis panel uses a donut chart and a text summary to show threat concentration. It includes an interactive slider labeled \"Select a percent of users.\" The summary states: **\"5% of users were linked to 72.9% of your endpoint threats.\"** The chart legend identifies the segments as \"5% of Users\" (Orange) and \"Other Users\" (Blue).\n\n### 6. Endpoint Threat Severity\nA donut chart and corresponding table breaking down event severity by percentage:\n*   Medium: 34%\n*   High: 33.2%\n*   Low: 32.9%\n*   Critical: 0%\n\n### 7. Endpoint Operating System (OS) Distribution\nA data table intended to display host OS names and corresponding device counts. The current status indicates: **\"There are no records to show.\"**",

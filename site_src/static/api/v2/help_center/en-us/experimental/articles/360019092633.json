You'll need to review the publishing and completion settings, as well as the size of your file, and attempt to correct the issue. Delete your language file and try again with an updated file.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1SXGBW7F3J9PQHY7TNYZKR'>User Issues With Uploaded Training</h2>\n<p>As a best practice, once your content is uploaded and published, you should enroll yourself in a training campaign to review the uploaded content within the KnowBe4 learner experience. When testing your content in this manner, you should also use a browser and operating system that the majority of your users will use. This allows you to mimic the conditions they will experience.</p>\n<p>If you experience issues when testing the training in the learner experience, the potential causes could include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Browser extensions or applications\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>To test if this is the cause of your issue, we recommend attempting to test the training in a private window (Example: Incognito in Google Chrome, InPrivate Browsing in Internet Explorer) with all of your extensions turned off. You can then introduce them one by one until you determine which extension is causing the issue.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Browser compatibility and settings\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>We recommend using the latest version of a popular browser. Review our browser compatibility article <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204467478-What-Browser-Should-I-Use-'>here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1SXGBWRDMDAQ9DBNG1H4J8'>Additional Resources</h2>\n<p>Still need assistance?

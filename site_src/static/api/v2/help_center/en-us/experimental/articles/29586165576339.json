  "body": "<p>Google User Provisioning (GUP) is an automated method for importing users from your Google Workspace tenant directly into your KnowBe4 console. This integration allows you to use data from Google Workspace to provision users in your KnowBe4 console. Changes that you make to your users\u2019 information and statuses in Google Workspace will sync automatically to your KnowBe4 console. Once you have configured the integration, you\u2019ll be able to manage all your users from one place.</p>\n<p>This integration requires you to have access to a Google super-admin account. The admin account must have the permissions to configure the six Google scopes that are required by this integration. For the full list of required scopes, see the <a href='#h_01HZHK4XWS273NA90MS3P8BVY2'>What You Will Need</a> section of this article. If you are not a Google customer, KnowBe4 also offers other methods of automated user provisioning. For further information about alternative user provisioning methods, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360052380374.html'>SCIM Configuration Guide</a> or our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228373888.html'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HZHK0BFY6VVBX05GSMTJ7ZP4'>How GUP Works</h2>\n<p>Using your Google <strong>Customer ID</strong> and your KnowBe4 <strong>Client ID</strong>, you can configure a direct connection between your Google Workspace environment and your KnowBe4 console. Once this connection has been established, you can configure which of your Google Workspace users and groups you would like to sync into your KnowBe4 console. Changes that you make to your users in Google Workspace will be reflected automatically in your KnowBe4 console.</p>\n<p>This sync is an automated process that occurs repeatedly throughout the day. Syncs will occur every six hours at minimum. The sync is a one-way process, and any changes made to users in your KnowBe4 console will not sync to your Google Workspace environment. Changes made to users directly in your KnowBe4 console will be overwritten by the data in Google Workspace. Any users in your KnowBe4 console who are not present in Google Workspace will be archived during the next GUP sync.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout_content'>\n<strong>Note: </strong> You have the option to prevent any specific users from being managed by GUP. To prevent specific users from being managed by GUP, create a CSV file with a list of users that you don\u2019t want to be managed by GUP. Enter \u201cfalse\u201d under the <strong>Provisioning Managed</strong> heading for those users.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HZHK1SW9Z685B81GY3M1R0H0'>Prerequisites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You must have admin access to your organization's KnowBe4 console.</li>\n<li>You must have super-admin access to Google Workspace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01HZHK45DHHA6N5PA6GTGZ3D9H'>Configuring Your Google Workspace Connection</h2>\n<p>In order to configure GUP, you\u2019ll need to connect your KnowBe4 console to your Google Workspace tenant.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HZHK4XWS273NA90MS3P8BVY2'>What You Will Need</h3>\n<p>You will need to gather the KnowBe4 <strong>Client ID</strong> and list of six scopes from your KnowBe4 <strong>Account Settings</strong> in order to complete the connection to Google Workspace.

If you have not yet established the Google Workspace connection, see the <a href='#h_01HZHK45DHHA6N5PA6GTGZ3D9H'>Configuring Your Google Workspace Connection</a> section above.</p>\n<p>Prior to running your first sync, we strongly recommend keeping your KnowBe4 console in <strong>Test Mode</strong> in order to verify that you are happy with the results of your sync. <strong>Test Mode</strong> enables you to see the users who would be included in your sync before they are added to your KnowBe4 console. This will allow you to make any necessary adjustments to your configuration prior to any users actually being provisioned. For further information about placing your console into <strong>Test Mode</strong>, see the <strong>User Provisioning</strong> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/12731036715411.html'>KnowBe4 Console Account Settings: User Management</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HZJ02EHKNNRH30CDYHCYAF4D'>User Scoping</h3>\n<p>To begin configuring your <strong>User Scoping</strong>, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After logging in to your KnowBe4 console, navigate to <strong>Users</strong> &gt; <strong>Provisioning</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the top-right corner, click the <strong>Configure Google Provisioning</strong> button.<img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Google_User_Provisioning/ClickConfigureGoogleProvisioningAnnotated.png'>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before continuing, you\u2019ll need to determine how you would like to sync your users into your KnowBe4 console. You\u2019ll have the option to sync by domain and group membership, OU scoping, or a combination of both methods. We generally recommend that customers start by adding a domain and then configuring users and groups for syncing. This method is the only method that allows you to sync group membership information into your KnowBe4 console.</p>\n<p>If you would like to sync users by adding a domain and configuring groups for syncing, proceed to the <a href='#h_01J5BH8XZJB67NTA9SAWEA66F8'>Syncing By Domain and Group Membership</a> section below.

You can specify which groups you would like to include for syncing, and you can also choose to exclude specific groups from the sync. This option may be useful if there are nested groups that you would like to exclude from a larger group. A nested group is a Google group that is a member of another group, and it will be included by default during the sync unless it is manually excluded.\n<p>Group names must be unique in order to sync into your KnowBe4 console, even if they are located in different domains.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout_content'>\n<strong>Note: </strong> You will need to type the name of the group that you would like to include or exclude in order to select them from the drop-down menus.

For example, if you are including an OU for syncing, GUP will include all users who are part of that OU, as well as any users contained within OUs that are nested under it. If you sync users using only OU scoping, group membership information will not be synced to your KnowBe4 console.

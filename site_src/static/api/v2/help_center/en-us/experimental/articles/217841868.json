A tooltip is visible on the graph, highlighting the data point for July 13, 2020, showing a \"Phish-prone\" percentage of \"20.8%.\" Instructions beneath the title advise the user to \"Click and drag in the plot area to zoom in.\"\n\n**Secondary Data (Clicker Table):**\nA section titled \"Top 50 Clickers\" displays a tabular list of users who clicked phishing links. Columns include Name, Email, and Clicks. The data shows users with click counts ranging from 5 down to 4 in the visible entries (e.g., Arianne Ullrich, Kathline Emard, and Kenia Nienow each have 5 clicks). An accompanying action link, \"Download Top Clickers,\" allows export of this specific dataset.",

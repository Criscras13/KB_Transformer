PPP is described as the percentage of employees prone to clicking on a phishing link, calculated by the ratio of total failures to the total number of emails delivered in a campaign.\n2.  **Example Paragraph:** A quantitative example illustrates the calculation: 100 recipients, 52 clicks (resulting in a 52 percent failure rate). The text notes that if eight of those individuals also entered data on the landing page, the Phish-prone Percentage for that campaign would increase to 60 percent, indicating varying weights for failure types.\n3.  **Hyperlink (UI Element):** The bottom of the panel contains a functional hyperlink, rendered in blue and underlined, labeled: \"How Phish-Prone Percentage Is Calculated.\" This element suggests connectivity to supplementary documentation detailing the precise calculation algorithm.",

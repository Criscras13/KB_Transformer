You can also create custom dashboards to organize your scan data based on your organization's needs.</p>\n<p>See the sections below to learn how to run scans, create custom dashboards, and view your results from each type of widget. For general information about PasswordIQ, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406004172435' target='_self'>PasswordIQ Product Manual</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HNNADTZ3NVZ403D7BY4M7NF3'>Running Scans</h2>\n<p>You can run scans and create scan schedules from your PasswordIQ dashboard. We recommend that you create a scan schedule instead of running individual scans so that you can continually monitor your organization's data.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To learn how to run scans and create scan schedules from your dashboard, see the subsections below.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HNNADTZ3YEK69NTYN4R1QS6P'>Running Individual Scans</h3>\n<p>If you would like to receive data between scheduled scans, you can run an individual scan. For example, if your scan schedule runs every Monday and Friday and you prompt your users to resolve their password vulnerabilities on Tuesday, you could run an individual scan on Wednesday. With this individual scan, you could verify that the password vulnerabilities were resolved between scheduled scans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To run an individual scan from your dashboard, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT account.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>PasswordIQ</strong> tab. When you select this tab, you'll be taken to your dashboard.\u00a0</li>\n<li>In the top-right corner of the page, click the <strong>Scan Now</strong> button.\u00a0When your scan completes, the time and date will display in the <strong>Last Scan </strong>bar at the top of the page.\u00a0 \n<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/PIQ/Dashboard+Article/PasswordIQ_Dashboard+Scan+Now+button.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/PIQ/Dashboard+Article/PasswordIQ_Dashboard+Scan+Now+button.png' alt='Scan Now Button'></a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01HNNADTZ3F7BYRBX6T6DRHV28'>Creating a Scan Schedule</h3>\n<p>From your dashboard, you can also create a scan schedule that initiates scans from your PasswordIQ client. The scan schedule will run weekly. Depending on your organization's needs, you can run a scan up to seven times per week.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If you have multiple AD accounts, the scan schedule will apply to each AD account.</div>\n</div>\n<p>To create a scan schedule from your dashboard, follow the steps below:\u00a0</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT account.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>PasswordIQ</strong> tab.

For more information, see the screenshot and list below:\n<ol role='list' type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Name</strong>: Enter a name for the widget. If you have multiple versions of the same widget, you can use the name to differentiate between the widgets.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Vulnerability Type</strong>: Select the type of vulnerability that the widget will display data for. For example, if\u00a0you select the <strong>Shared Password</strong> vulnerability, the widget will only display data for that vulnerability.\u00a0\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>By default, all widgets except for the <strong>User Table</strong> widget will display data for the <strong>Weak Password</strong> vulnerability.

For example, if you are customizing a widget and you select \"Group 1\" and \"Group 2\" for the <strong>Group</strong> filter, the widget will only display data for those two groups.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Date</strong> <strong>Range</strong>: Select the date range that the widget will display data for.

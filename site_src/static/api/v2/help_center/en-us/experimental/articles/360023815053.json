    "body": "<p>You have the ability to enable surveys for your training campaigns. If enabled, your users will be prompted to take a survey after they complete each training assignment, with the exception of assessments and policies. The survey asks your users to provide feedback regarding certain attributes of the content they just completed. The survey also offers the ability to leave a text comment. From your campaign results area, you can review all ratings and feedback provided by your users.</p>\n<p>Enabling surveys helps you keep in touch with your users to see if your training strategy is effective. These surveys allow users to communicate their thoughts about the type of content you're assigning, which gives you the insight you need to create more effective training campaigns.</p>\n\n<h2 id='h_01GTW92HC6BKRFZ2DAC0PHVBP8'>Enabling Surveys</h2>\n<p>You can enable surveys when creating a <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204948207-Training-Campaigns-and-Content-Management#CREATING' target='_self'>new campaign</a> or when <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204948207-Training-Campaigns-and-Content-Management#EDIT' target='_self'>editing an existing campaign</a>.

This prompt will display after the user closes their training content window in their Learner Experience (LX). The survey asks them to rate the content on a scale from one to five stars based on the following attributes:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Helpfulness of Content</li>\n<li>Length of Content</li>\n<li>Presentation of Content</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The attributes in the content survey are not customizable.

Users can leave a comment of up to 255 characters. They can also click <strong>Skip</strong> to opt out of the survey.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>There is no option to prevent your user from skipping a survey.

Click the <strong>Survey Results</strong> subtab within a campaign to review your survey results.</p>\n<p>From this subtab, you'll be able to see the average survey results and the number of completed surveys for each piece of content. If you would like, you can download these results as a CSV file by clicking the <strong>Download CSV</strong> button in the top-right corner. If you have allowed users to leave comments, these comments will be included in the CSV file as well.<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/surveys/surveyresults.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KMSAT/surveys/surveyresults.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n\n<p>The numbers below each attribute represent the average rating users assigned to it. This number is calculated by adding the rating users gave for a particular attribute, then dividing that number by the total number of responses, and then rounding to the first decimal point. The formula for this calculation is written below:</p>\n<p>The total sum of an attribute's rating from all respondents / The total number of responses.</p>\n<p>As an example, let's say that three of your users completed the same content. If one user rated the presentation of the content as five stars, one user rated it as three stars, and the other user rated it as two stars, then the overall rating for the presentation of that course would be 3.3 stars. The formula for this calculation is written below:</p>\n<p>(5 + 3 + 2) / 3.</p>\n<p><a href='#h_01GTW4YT83HF1BSS1C7MGM0NVW' target='_self'>Back to top</a></p>\n\n<h3 id='h_01GTW556WM1B6TV3KQDS14X10H'>Using Survey Results</h3>\n<p>You can use the results of your survey to stay informed on the type of content that your users find the most engaging. Assigning content that your users find engaging makes them more likely to finish their training on time. If you use training that users find unhelpful or difficult to understand, you can view that feedback in your survey results and adjust your next training campaign accordingly.</p>\n<p>For example, if you receive negative survey feedback regarding the length of the content you are assigning to users, you can select different training content for your next training campaign. In response to your survey results, you could instead assign training content that is more concise, or you could set up multiple training campaigns using shorter training content to be assigned over the next several weeks or months.\u00a0</p>\n",

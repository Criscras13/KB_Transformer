  "body": "<p>From the <strong>Threat Intel</strong> subtab of your PhishER Settings, you can configure the Threat Intel feature for your PhishER console. Threat Intel is powered by a Webroot integration with PhishER Plus. Webroot\u2019s BrightCloud Web Classification &amp; Web Reputation Service uses machine learning-based intelligence to analyze URLs for malicious content. This integration uses the Webroot API to allow PhishER to submit URLs for analysis, pull report data, and perform advanced search queries.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Threat Intel is only available for accounts with PhishER Plus. You do not need a separate Webroot subscription to configure the Threat Intel feature.</div>\n</div>\n<p>After Threat Intel scans a URL, a threat analysis report will be available under the <strong>Domains &amp; URLs</strong> subtab on the <strong>Message Details</strong> page of your PhishER console. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/13169303385619#VIEWMSGDETAILS'>PhishER Inbox Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HSBWVDPNCW0TTR1FPRTQ62E8'>Configuring the Integration</h2>\n<p>To configure the integration, fill out the fields on the <strong>Threat Intel</strong> subtab of your PhishER Settings. For more information, see the screenshot and list below:<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/Settings/ThreatIntel/EN/ThreatIntelSettings.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/Settings/ThreatIntel/EN/ThreatIntelSettings.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<ol role='list' type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Threat Intel Disabled or Threat Intel Enabled</strong>: Use this toggle to disable or enable the integration.</li>\n<li>(Optional) <strong>Automatic Scanning Settings</strong>: In this section, you can configure settings that allow Threat Intel to automatically scan parts of a message. To learn about these options, view the list below:\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatically Scan All URLs</strong>: If you select this check box, all of the URLs in your PhishER Inbox will automatically be sent to Threat Intel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Update Threat Intel Settings</strong>: Click this button if you would like to save changes made to the integration settings in this section.</li>\n<li>\u00a0(Optional) <strong>Automatic Scanning Timeout</strong>: The <strong>Timeout if no response in seconds </strong>field displays the custom timeout period for your Threat Intel scan results. If Threat Intel does not return scan results in this timeout period, a <strong>TI_BYPASSED</strong> tag will be applied to the corresponding message. By default, the timeout period is 120 seconds. To learn more about the tags that can be applied to the message, read the <a href='#iv_h_01HCB1YJCAHYHXSR1F5VAGS9A6'>Threat Intel Tags</a> section of this article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>(Optional) <strong>Ignored Domains</strong>: This section displays the domains that you would like Threat Intel to ignore when running a scan.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Update Shared Settings</strong>: If you would like to update the custom timeout period or the ignored domains for your integrations, click this button to open the <strong>Shared Integrations Settings</strong> pop-up window. In the pop-up window, you can enter a number of seconds in the <strong>Timeout if no response in seconds</strong>\u00a0field to set a custom timeout period for your Threat Intel scan results. In the <strong>Ignored Domains</strong> field, you can enter the domains that you would like Threat Intel to ignore when running a scan. Enter each domain as a new line in the text box. If you add a domain to this list, any subdomains of that domain will be excluded as well. However, if you add a subdomain to the list, the domain will not be excluded.

To learn about the threat Intel tags, view the list below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>TI_BYPASSED</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a Threat Intel scan times out. This tag is commonly attached with additional Threat Intel tags. You can set a custom timeout period under your Threat Intel<strong> Shared Integrations Settings</strong>.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>If a Threat Intel timeout occurs, PhishER will still wait for your Threat Intel results to return. However, automated actions will not run against the item while Threat Intel scans it.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>TI_ERROR</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a Threat Intel scan results in processing errors or when Threat Intel is unable to scan a domain or URL.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>TI_HIGH_RISK</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a Threat Intel scan determines that a threat was detected and the scanned domains or URLs are a high risk.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>TI_IGNORED</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when URLs or domains found on your <strong>Ignored Domains</strong> list are detected on a message.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>TI_LOW_RISK</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a Threat Intel scan determines that no threat was detected but the scanned domains or URLs are a low risk.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>TI_MODERATE_RISK</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a Threat Intel scan determines that a possible threat was detected and the scanned domains or URLs are a moderate risk.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>TI_NOT_FOUND</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a Threat Intel scan doesn\u2019t return a match for the scanned domains or URLs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>TI_PENDING</strong>: This tag is attached to your message when a Threat Intel scan is queued.

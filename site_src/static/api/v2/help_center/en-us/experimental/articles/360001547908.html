All of our styled templates are tagged with the words <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360018763253.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>(Banner)</a> or <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360018763253.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>(Border)</a> in the template name. You can customize the style of these templates by making edits in the <a href='#SOURCE'>source code</a>. If you're unfamiliar with HTML, each blank template includes instructional HTML comments in the source code to help guide you through the customization process.

Instead of embedding your images or uploading your images for us to host, using the linking method serves two mutually beneficial purposes. First, we provide a means for you to make more realistic templates that may help preserve the integrity and proportions of the images that you add to your templates. Second, linking your images decreases the amount of content you have to share with us to achieve the same outcome as uploading your images to the console.</p>",

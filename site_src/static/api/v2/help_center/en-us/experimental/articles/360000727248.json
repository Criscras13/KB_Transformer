You can access the <strong>Policy Management</strong> module from the <strong>Policy Management</strong> tab of your navigation panel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this module, you can create policy management users and groups to assign policies to users in your organization. After you've created users and groups, you can create campaigns to send policies to your users. As your users acknowledge the policies, you can monitor the progress of each campaign.\u00a0</p>\n<p>See the sections below to learn how to create policy management users and groups, create policy management users, create policy campaigns, and monitor policy campaigns from your platform.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a name='USER_ROLES'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J8J4BN03CWA1FJZNGYPEYJXJ'>Policy Management User Roles</h2>\n<p>The four user roles below can view, create, manage, or edit policy management campaigns.

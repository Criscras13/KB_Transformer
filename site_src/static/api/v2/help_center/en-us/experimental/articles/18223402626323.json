With these campaigns, you can help prepare your users for real callback phishing attacks, also known as reverse vishing attacks. In these campaigns, users will receive an email with a phone number and a callback code. If they call the phone number, they'll be prompted to enter the callback code. Once they enter the callback code, they'll be asked to enter personal information.</p>\n<div style='padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;'><iframe style='position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;' title='Callback Phishing Promotional Video' src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/846027109?h=4db84cbcc8&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media'></iframe></div>\n<p>\n<script src='https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js'></script>\n</p>\n<h2 id='iv_01H84ZQDJM4GNRBPMY3CPERZB9'>Creating a Callback Phishing Campaign</h2>\n<div class='callout-warning'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong>Make sure you import your users into the KSAT console before creating a callback phishing campaign.

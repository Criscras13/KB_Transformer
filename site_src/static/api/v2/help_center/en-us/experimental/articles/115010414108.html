  "body": "<p>Every month, we update our <strong>Security Hints and Tips</strong> message category with hints and tips about common cybersecurity topics, such as the importance of using a VPN and protecting passwords. These messages can help keep your users informed about security threats and help reinforce the topics they learn about in their security training.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HHD23KPSJCH6S9H8G8V8G0XF'>Set Up a Security Hints and Tips Message</h2>\n<p>Users will be able to view their Security Hints and Tips on the <strong>Messages</strong> tab of the Learner Experience (LX). You can send these messages once, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or quarterly, and you also have the option to send a copy of the message to each user via email. For general information about messages, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4416416555155'>User Messaging Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>When you use our User Messaging feature to send the Security Hints and Tips message to your users, the message template will be chosen using <strong>Random (Same random email to all users)</strong> logic. This logic chooses templates at random from your selected categories and ensures that users don't receive the same template multiple times. For more information about <strong>Random (Same random email to all users)</strong> logic, see the Random section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500003848062'>Automated Template Selection Overview</a> article.</p>\n<p>To create a Security Hints and Tips message, follow the steps below after navigating to <strong>Users</strong> &gt; <strong>Messages</strong> from the KnowBe4 Console.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users+and+groups/security_hints_and_tips_user_messaging.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users+and+groups/security_hints_and_tips_user_messaging.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Message Type:</strong> Select <strong>Security Hints and Tips</strong> from the menu.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Frequency:</strong> Choose how often Security Hints and Tips messages should be sent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Send to</strong>: To send Security Hints and Tips to your entire organization, select <strong>All Users</strong>.

When using a frequency other than <strong>One-time</strong>, each subsequent message will be sent on the day of the week that was selected.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Also send this message as an email</strong>: Select this check box to send a copy of the Security Hints and Tips message to each user via email. This message will still be listed on the <strong>Messages</strong> tab of the LX. Emails sent using the <strong>User Messaging</strong> feature are not tracked and will not be included in any message-related data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Use Custom Sender Information</strong>: Enable this option to customize the sender's name and email address. The email address must match one of the allowed domains on your account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Show Preview</strong>: This option displays a preview of the Security Hints and Tips message to be sent. If you want to edit this message, go to <strong>Manage Templates</strong>, then clone it from the <strong>System Templates</strong>.

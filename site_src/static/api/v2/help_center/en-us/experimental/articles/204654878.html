See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360043196354.html'>KnowBe4's Training Instances</a> article for a full list of login links.</p>\n<p>This can result in users mistyping or misformatting their email addresses, creating duplicate user accounts in your user list. To prevent users from doing this, you can turn off the <strong>Allow Users to Signup</strong> option by following the steps below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From your KnowBe4 console, click your email address in the top right corner and select <strong>Account Settings</strong>.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>User Settings</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Click on the enabled <strong>Allow Users to Create Accounts</strong> checkbox to disable this feature. This will prevent users from signing up with email addresses that have not already been imported into your Users area.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FAQ/01+Disable+Allow+Signup.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FAQ/01+Disable+Allow+Signup.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Users who attempt to log in without an account already created for them will receive an error message saying that the account \"doesn't allow self-registration\". If you are the main owner of your KnowBe4 account and receive this message, contact KnowBe4 support for assistance. If you are a user who is attempting to log in for training and receive this message, contact your supervisor or IT team.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> New KnowBe4 accounts will have this Allow Users to Signup feature turned off by default.

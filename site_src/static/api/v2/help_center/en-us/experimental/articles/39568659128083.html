  "body": "<p>You can integrate <a href='https://www.redvector.ai/platforms/fulcrum.html'>Red Vector\u2019s Fulcrum</a> platform into your KSAT console. Fulcrum integrates cyber, human, and open-source intelligence to identify and mitigate insider threats proactively. Integrating Fulcrum with KSAT can help you identify possible workplace threats earlier by performing risk analysis. This integration also allows you to assign training campaigns to reduce workplace risks.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JPSZKQRCV48F5FF9HPD1KDQM'>Connecting Fulcrum to Your KSAT Console</h2>\n<p>Before you set up Smart Groups in KSAT and create custom events in Fulcrum, you must create a <strong>User Event API key</strong> in KSAT\u2019s Account Settings.

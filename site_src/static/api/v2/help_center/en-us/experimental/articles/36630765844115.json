If you are running a phishing campaign and see unusual results, you may be experiencing false clicks. When reviewing campaign results, if you see a 100 percent click rate or IP addresses that don't belong to your organization, this can indicate false positives. The <strong>False-Positive Phishing Evasion</strong> settings can minimize incidences of false positives, giving you more accurate phishing campaign results. For more information about bot clicks, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059091413-Identify-and-Address-False-Positives#h_01HBVJBX3Q8HQQHBG2TN86YJPR'><strong>How to Identify Bot Clicks</strong></a> section of our <strong><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059091413-Identify-and-Address-False-Positives'>Identify and Address False Positives</a></strong> article.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>False-Positive Phishing Evasion settings are not meant to replace proper whitelisting. These settings are meant to be used as a tool to help with false positives along with whitelisting. You still need to troubleshoot false positives to confirm proper whitelisting. For more information on setting up whitelisting in your KSAT console, please consult our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645138-Whitelisting-Guide'>Whitelisting Guide</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>False positives in phishing simulations often stem from improper whitelisting practices, link scanner interference, or incorrectly configured security policies. To minimize these issues, ensure your spam filters are properly set up to exclude KnowBe4 phishing emails from link scanning and probing activities.</p>\n<p>Verify that smart hosts and advanced delivery policies align with your campaign settings. When investigating false positives triggered by link scanners, review your whitelisting configurations and collaborate with IT admins to confirm that security settings meet organizational standards while reducing false-positive occurrences.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JFJKWPQCJ2N3C6H3QTM3NK9A'>Enabling False-Positive Phishing Evasion Settings</h2>\n<p>We refer to phishing failures not caused by a user clicking a phishing link as false positives. If not resolved, false positives can cause phishing campaign results in your <strong>Phishing Security Test Reports</strong> to be inaccurate.</p>\n<p>False-positive phishing evasion works by tracking when a hidden link in a sent Phishing Security Test (PST) is accessed. Phishing failures that occur after this hidden link is accessed are flagged and ignored if they occur within the configured <strong>Duration for Ignored Bot Failures</strong>. In addition, IP addresses for bot-associated failures and actual phishing test failures are compared by configuring the <strong>IP Address Match for Ignored Bot Failures</strong> setting.</p>\n<p>You can enable and customize the <strong>False-Positive Phishing Evasion</strong> settings in the <strong>Phishing</strong> section of <strong>Account Settings</strong>. See the below screenshots and list for more information about the settings in this section:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Ignore Bot-Associated Phishing Failures</strong>: Select this check box to ignore bot-associated phishing failures that occur soon after a hidden link is accessed. When this setting is enabled, the <strong>Duration for Ignored Bot Failures</strong> and <strong>IP Address Match for Ignored Bot Failures</strong> options will appear.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/False_Positives_AcctSettings1.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/False_Positives_AcctSettings1.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Duration for Ignored Bot Failures</strong>: Here, you can select the amount of time after a hidden link is accessed that subsequent bot-associated phishing failures are to be ignored. The selections available are <strong>Conservative (5 sec)</strong>, <strong>Balanced (10 sec)</strong>, and <strong>Inclusive (30 sec)</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>IP Address Match for Ignored Bot Failures</strong>: You can select match criteria to ignore bot-associated phishing failures based on the IP address of the hidden link being accessed compared to the IP address of potential bot-associated phishing failures. The selections are <strong>No Match</strong>, <strong>First Two Octets</strong>, and<strong> Exact Match</strong>. The <strong>First Two Octets</strong> option will match IP addresses based on their Class B network identifier. For example, if the IP address is 54.70.53.60, it will look for IP addresses within the 54.70.0.0/16 subnet.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FalsePositives_AccountSettings2.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FalsePositives_AccountSettings2.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01JFJM5G98XDGM394C142H04D7'>How to View Details of Ignored Bot-Associated Phishing Failures</h2>\n<p>After you have enabled the <strong>Ignore Bot-Associated Phishing Failures</strong> setting, ignored failures on your phishing tests can be viewed in the <strong>Users </strong>&gt;<strong> Ignored Failures</strong> page on your phishing campaigns.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The <strong>Ignored Failure</strong> tab will only show if there were failures ignored during the phishing campaign.</div>\n</div>\n<p>See the below screenshot and list for an explanation of the data located in this section:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FP_Ignored_Failure_Header_Annotated.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FP_Ignored_Failure_Header_Annotated.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Name and Email</strong>: This column displays the name and email address of the ignored bot-associated failure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Date and Time</strong>: This column displays the date and time of the ignored bot-associated failure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bot Event Interval</strong>: This column displays the amount of time in seconds after a hidden link was accessed that subsequent bot-associated phishing failures were ignored.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ignored Failure Type</strong>: This column displays the type of ignored bot-associated failure, in this case, \u201cClicked.\u201d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>IP Address</strong>: This column displays the IP address of the ignored bot-associated failure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Browser</strong>: This column displays the browser used by the bot-associated failure, such as Chrome.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Browser Version</strong>: This column displays the browser version used by the bot-associated failure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>OS</strong>: This column displays the operating system used for the bot-associated failure, such as Mac.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bot Events</strong>: This column displays the number of ignored failures for this user.

If you believe a user has failed a phishing test and the console shows an ignored failure event and not a phishing failure, then you can convert the ignored bot failure to a phishing campaign failure.</p>\n<p>To complete this conversion process, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In your KSAT console, go to <strong>Phishing &gt; Campaigns,</strong> then select your phishing campaign.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Users</strong>.</li>\n<li>At the right side of the <strong>Users</strong> section, click <strong>Ignored Failure</strong>.</li>\n<li>When you see an ignored failure you would like to convert to an actual phishing failure, click the <strong>trashcan</strong> icon on the right side of the screen.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FP_Ignored_Failure_Arrow1.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FP_Ignored_Failure_Arrow1.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>You will be asked if you want to convert the bot event to a campaign failure, as you cannot undo this action.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FP_Ignored_Failure_Confirm.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Phishing/FP_Ignored_Failure_Confirm.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Confirm</strong> button.</li>\n<li>An ignored failure can only be converted to a phishing failure once.

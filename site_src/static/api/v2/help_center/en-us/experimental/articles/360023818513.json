With these credentials, hackers can log in to the user's social media account to access personal information. They can also use <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_login' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>social login</a> to log in to their accounts or even create fake accounts with the user's credentials and identity. SPT can help you see how likely your users would be to fall for this type of attack should a real attack ever occur.</span></p>\n<p><span>SPT allows you to send your users one of three social media based phishing templates. You can also select the landing page, where the user will be directed to should they click on the link in the phishing template. If you select the landing page for the social media platform and the user clicks on the link in the email, your user will be directed to a fake login page. If they enter credentials and try to log in, they will be redirected to an error page.</span></p>\n<p><span>The results will display how many of your users clicked on a link in the email and how many of your users entered data on a landing page. You will be able to download a report with all of your results. <strong>SPT will <em>never</em> save any of the data entered on the landing page. We only track whether the user entered data, not the data itself.</strong></span></p>\n<p>Follow these steps below to complete your free SPT. You will not be required to download or install any software. The default test is limited to 100 employees. Please contact us if you need to send to more.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HSE93QPWHVXBSQM52MGKHB12'>Signing Up for a Free Account</h2>\n<p>If you already have a free account, skip to the <a href='#h_01HSE93QPWMBH0TAQJSHY3HEB5'>Setting Up a Social Media Phishing Test</a> section.</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Sign up for a free account here: <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/social-media-phishing-test' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>KnowBe4 Free Social Media Phishing Test</a>.</li>\n<li>After entering your information, you can either click <strong>Get Started</strong> or click the link provided in the email we will send you.</li>\n<li>On the next page, you'll be prompted to enter your work email address.

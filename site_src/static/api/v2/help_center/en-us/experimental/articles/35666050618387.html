Emails\" (0 to 160).\n*   **Graymail or Spam emails received (Chart):** This line graph tracks volume over the same period. The Gray line (\"Graymail\") shows a sharp spike, peaking over 100 emails around Feb 9, 2025. The Blue line (\"Spam\") remains consistently low, near the baseline.\n*   **Threat Feed (Event Log):** A chronological feed documenting security events, primarily \"Abuse Mailbox Reanalysis updated\" actions (statuses: Benign, Inconclusive, Dangerous) and \"New submission to Abuse Mailbox email address.\" All listed events are tagged as occurring \"3 days ago\" and include context such as submitter email addresses.\n\n**Row 3: Aggregate Distribution Donut Charts**\n\nThe bottom row features three donut charts displaying compositional breakdowns:\n\n1.  **Top types of phishing emails received:** Categories include Brand Impersonation, Scouting, Business Email Compromise, 419 Scam, and Technical.\n2.  **Top types of payloads in phishing emails:** Categories include Link, Social, Malware, Financial, and Attachment.\n3.  **Supply Chain Health:** Status breakdown categories include Pass, None, Fail, Error, and Other.",

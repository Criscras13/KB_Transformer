Instructions state this method maps users to **KMSAT user data fields**.\n\n*   **Rule Definition:** A single mapping rule is partially configured. It follows the structure: `[Source Vendor Field] [Operator] [Target KMSAT Field]`.\n    *   **Source:** Proofpoint field identified is **Hostname**.\n    *   **Operator:** **is** (Static text).\n    *   **Target:** Labeled **Knowbe4 User Data Field**, presented as a dropdown menu with the placeholder **Select option**.\n    *   **Action:** An **Add Field** button is associated with the target mapping.\n*   **Rule Expansion:** A hyperlink labeled **Add Another Rule** is present below the initial configuration, allowing for additional rules.\n\n**Action Buttons (Footer):**\nThe footer contains two critical action buttons:\n1.  **Save:** (Primary, solid blue button).\n2.  **Delete Integration:** (Secondary, red outlined button, indicating a destructive action).",

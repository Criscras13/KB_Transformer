Read the sections below to learn more.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>For more information on implementing the KSAT console, we recommend using our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010358067'>Automated Security Awareness Program (ASAP) Guide</a> article or reviewing our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/225574347'>Best Practices Guide: Integrate KnowBe4 into Your Organization </a>article.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01GTETG1XPSCWF7XVBXS55GQK3'>Step 1: Add Your Users</h2>\n<p>You can add your users to your KSAT console to send them simulated phishing emails and enroll them in training campaigns. You have multiple options for adding your users to your KSAT console. Review your options and the associated articles linked below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User Provisioning: This is the preferred method for syncing users to your KSAT console and maintaining your user list over time. You can use our Active Directory Integration (ADI) or SCIM to automatically provision users in your KSAT console. To learn more, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/228373888'>Active Directory Integration (ADI) Configuration Guide</a> or our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052380374'>SCIM Configuration Guide</a>.</li>\n<li>Quick Import: This method is useful for importing fewer than 100 users. To learn more, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204936887-Users-and-Groups#QUICKIMPORT'>Quick Import</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204936887-Users-and-Groups'>Users and Groups Management Guide</a>.</li>\n<li>CSV Import: This method is useful for importing a larger number of users and for including other user data such as names, phone numbers, group memberships, and more. To learn more, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204873347'>Import Users with a CSV File</a> article.</li>\n<li>Other: There are other ways you can import users for your specific organization. If you need specific advice, please reach out to our customer support team or read the below articles from our Knowledge Base:\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005778507'>Import Users from Active Directory Using PowerShell</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204654288'>Multiple Email Domains</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01GTETG976YN5R639H9R0BQDCQ'>Step 2: Conduct a Baseline Phishing Test</h2>\n<p>Before you begin your security awareness training program, we strongly recommend that you send a baseline phishing test to all of your users. You can use this test as a starting point for your security awareness training program.</p>\n<p>To learn more about our recommendations for the baseline phishing process, see the below subsections or our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/226676668-Video-One-Minute-Baseline-Change-Your-Password-Clicks-'>One Minute Baseline Phishing Campaign For Clicks</a> video.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong>Before you begin this step, please ensure you've whitelisted KnowBe4's IP addresses or domains in your email environment. Use our <a href='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/supporttools/whitelisting-wizard.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Whitelisting Wizard</a> or review our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/203645138'>Whitelisting Guide</a> to learn how to whitelist your email client and spam filters.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01GTEV7Z9715EJBJZEV4D9VQT1'>Preliminary Test Campaign</h3>\n<p>Before you create a baseline phishing campaign for your users, we recommend running at least one test campaign that is limited to a small group of users, such as your IT team.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this preliminary test campaign is to ensure that you have whitelisted correctly and that the emails pass through your spam filters and firewall protection.</p>\n<p>This preliminary campaign will also ensure that clicks and other phishing test failures are tracked in your account. Click the simulated phishing link in your test email to ensure that failures are being tracked in your account. To learn more, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204239938'>Create and Manage Phishing Campaigns</a> article or our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/217841868-Monitoring-and-Reviewing-Individual-Phishing-Campaigns'>Monitor and Review Phishing Campaigns</a> article.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>When you are done with your preliminary test, you should delete or <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000440548'>hide the campaign</a> so that it will not interfere with your reports or <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/30048977242259'>Risk Score</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='h_01GTEVFWM8WEF176V8K1VZ6NTF'>Establishing a Baseline</h3>\n<p>After you have confirmed that your preliminary phishing test campaign was successful, you will create a baseline phishing test campaign for all of your users. This test will show your organization\u2019s initial Phish-prone Percentage. Consider the initial Phish-prone Percentage as your starting point. Use this initial Phish-prone Percentage to measure the success of your security awareness training plan.</p>\n<p>To learn about our recommendations for setting up your baseline phishing campaign, please see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010347968-What-is-the-Best-Method-for-Setting-up-a-Baseline-Test-'>Best Practices Guide: Set Up a Baseline Test</a> article or our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/205072727-What-Email-Should-I-Use-in-My-Initial-Baseline-Test-'>Baseline Test Template Recommendations</a> article.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01GTEVRV9R1AHC2V75HHDK1Q4J'>Send a Baseline Test to Your IT Team</h3>\n<p>Another option you may want to consider is to send two baseline phishing tests: one to your IT or help desk department first, and then a separate one to the rest of your employees afterward. This way, when the rest of your employees begin reporting the suspicious email, your IT or help desk employees will be aware of the situation, and they will also have had the chance to participate in the baseline assessment. In addition, this is a great way to ensure you\u2019ve whitelisted our mail servers effectively, and that your baseline test will reach everyone\u2019s inbox.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01GTETGH74M0W7381VM1HA22MF'>Step 3: Train Your Users</h2>\n<p>For your initial security awareness training campaign, we recommend that you enroll all of your users in the 45-minute KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training or another comprehensive course.

These plans are categorized by those awareness levels. Your organization's awareness level is based on the maturity level that you would like to achieve with your security awareness training program. To learn more about different awareness levels, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/225574347-Best-Practices-Guide-How-Do-I-Effectively-Integrate-KnowBe4-Into-My-Organization-'>Best Practices Guide: Integrate KnowBe4 into Your Organization</a> article.</p>\n<p>If you aren't sure which plan is right for you, take a look at some of our general recommendations for security awareness training in the subsections below.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01GTEWBR1ARQKM71005RFSE84T'>Ongoing Phishing Campaign Recommendations</h3>\n<p>At a minimum, send a phishing test to all of your users on a monthly basis. You can do this by creating a monthly phishing campaign using the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include multiple email categories and include different types of phishing tests.</li>\n<li>Spread emails out over a longer duration, such as one week. That way, users will not know when they are going to receive a phishing test.</li>\n<li>Add the users who fail the phishing test to a <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/206280728-Using-Groups-for-Remedial-Training'>remedial training group</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to your monthly phishing tests for all users, we recommend that you set up additional tests for your high-risk groups or users who are more vulnerable to a phishing attack.</p>\n<p>To learn how to determine which of your groups or users are the highest risk to your organization, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/30048977242259'>SmartRisk Agent\u2122 and Risk Score v2 Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>To learn more about creating and customizing phishing campaigns, see the following articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204239938-Creating-and-Managing-Phishing-Campaigns'>Create and Manage Phishing Campaigns</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204240768'>Create and Edit Email Templates and Landing Pages</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204949707-How-To-Use-Placeholders'>Placeholders Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035472113-How-to-Use-Placeholders-Use-Cases'>Use Cases for Placeholders</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01GTEWGDN0V02VSCTMA51KNW07'>Ongoing Training Recommendations</h3>\n<p>Below you\u2019ll find our minimum recommendations for conducting ongoing security awareness training in any organization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a remedial training group and a remedial training campaign.

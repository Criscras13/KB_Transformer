  "body": "<p>KnowBe4\u2019s integration with D3 Security combines KSAT training results with the D3 Security XGEN SOAR platform. With this integration, your SOAR platform can analyze data and automate response processes, such as incident response, in your KSAT console. You can use this integration to monitor your users\u2019 training and phishing campaign results, identify your high-risk users, and automate response commands in your KSAT console. For example, the XGEN SOAR platform can identify high-risk users who fail Phishing Security Tests (PSTs) by analyzing their phishing campaign results and Phish-prone Percentage. Then, the platform can trigger automatic updates to the users\u2019 Risk Scores in your KSAT console.</p>\n<p>When you set up your integration, you will be able to customize your commands and connections. Commands are the actions available within an integration. Connections are the credentials added for an integration. Setting up commands and connections will allow you to customize workflows for this integration. You can also configure additional connection parameters if you would like.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the types of integrations that D3 Security offers, visit their <a href='https://d3security.com/platform/soar-platform-overview/' target='_self'>website</a>.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Before you set up this integration, you'll need to copy the <strong>User Event API Token</strong> from your KSAT<strong> Account Settings</strong>.

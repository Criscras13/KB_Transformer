  "body": "<p>KnowBe4 currently has two versions of SCIM: a supported version and a legacy version that is no longer supported. This guide will show you how to update your KnowBe4 account from the legacy version of SCIM to the new version of SCIM.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong><strong>Note:</strong> If you're currently using Legacy SCIM with Azure and would like to upgrade to SCIM, you will need to either edit your existing <strong>KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training</strong> application in Azure or add the new SCIM application from the Azure Gallery. You aren't able to modify your existing, custom Azure application that is used for Legacy SCIM. To learn how to set up a new Azure application, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360053851814.html'>How to Configure SCIM for Azure</a> article. You can keep the Azure application that you used for Legacy SCIM while testing SCIM as long as you pause the Legacy SCIM application from syncing by clicking <strong>Stop Provisioning</strong> in your Azure admin console. Once the new SCIM connection is established and verified, you can remove the legacy application.\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HER2C82HB5JR64P12D6DN1BY'>Updating to the Newest Version</h2>\n<p>Updating your account to the newest version of SCIM will provide your organization with important security and feature updates. See the steps below to update your account to the new version of SCIM.</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>Log in to your KnowBe4 account.</li>\n<li>Click on your email address in the top-right corner of the page and click <strong>Account Settings</strong>.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>User Management</strong> &gt; <strong>User Provisioning</strong> and click <strong>SCIM</strong>.</li>\n<li class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong> You can toggle between the two SCIM options in your <strong>Account Settings</strong>. Your KnowBe4 account will only process SCIM syncs from the selected SCIM option in your <strong>Account Settings</strong>. If you have SCIM selected, any Legacy SCIM syncs received from your Okta identity provider to your KnowBe4 account will display as <strong>Skipped</strong> in your <strong>Sync Reports</strong> page. <a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SCIM/LegacySCIM_01.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/SCIM/LegacySCIM_01.png' alt=' '></a>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Expand your SCIM settings by clicking <strong>+ SCIM Settings</strong>.</li>\n<li>Generate SCIM Token. This button will open a new window with your token ID. Copy this ID and save it to a place that you can easily access later. It is important that you save this token because once you close this window, you cannot view the token again. Once you\u2019ve saved the token, click OK to close the window.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Once your SCIM token is generated, the <strong>Generate SCIM Token</strong> button will change to the <strong>Regenerate SCIM Token</strong> button. See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360052380374.html'>SCIM Configuration Guide</a> for more information about the button.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Copy the <strong>Tenant URL</strong> and save it to a place that you can easily access later.</li>\n<li>Make sure that the <strong>Test Mode</strong> option is enabled.\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong><strong>Note:</strong> We recommend keeping <strong>Test Mode</strong> enabled until you\u2019ve configured the connection between KnowBe4 and your identity provider and have run a successful sync. Test Mode is used to generate a report of what will happen when SCIM is enabled. This means that no changes are made to your console, so you can configure your setup without worrying about changes to your console. When you're ready, you can disable <strong>Test Mode</strong> from your <strong>Account Settings</strong> to enable syncing. If you're switching from <strong>ADI</strong> to <strong>SCIM</strong> or from <strong>Legacy SCIM</strong> to <strong>SCIM</strong>, <strong>Test Mode</strong> will be enabled automatically after you click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Scroll down to the bottom of the Account Settings page and click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now that you've enabled the newest SCIM version in your KnowBe4 account, you're ready to finalize the connection with your identity provider.

This module is designed to simplify the processes of identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating the various risks faced by your organization. See our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360010819154.html' target='_self'>Risk Management Module Guide</a>\u00a0for an introduction to risk management with KCM GRC.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <strong>Risk Dashboard</strong> page provides an overview of the risks that you've added to your risk management module.\u00a0Navigate to the <strong>Risk Dashboard</strong> by clicking <strong>Risk Management</strong>\u00a0&gt;<strong>\u00a0Dashboard</strong> from the navigation panel on the left-hand side of your account.</p>\n<p>This article explains the four areas that make up the <strong>Risk Dashboard</strong>.

The top risks are measured by the risks' inherent risk scores.

Here, you can view the percentage of risks in each category of your risk register on the <strong>Risks by Category </strong>graph. You can also view data about the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360042334914.html' target='_self'>inherent risk score</a> for each category of your risk register on the <strong>Inherent Risk Score by Category </strong>graph. To learn more about risk categories, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360011109733.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>How to Use Your Risk Register</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about each graph, please see the descriptions below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <strong>Risks by Category</strong> pie graph shows the percentage of risk for each category. This graph helps you compare the number of risks for the different categories so that you can identify which categories have the largest number of risks. For example, in the graph below, the Operational &amp; Infrastructure category has the largest number of risks. You can use this information to prioritize your compliance efforts in that category.\u00a0<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCM+Risk+Management/Risk+Dashboard/KCM_Risks+by+Category+Graph.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCM+Risk+Management/Risk+Dashboard/KCM_Risks+by+Category+Graph.png' alt='Risks by Category Graph PNG'></a></p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Inherent Risk Score by Category</strong> pie graph shows the percentage of inherent risk for each category. This percentage accounts for both the average inherent risk score for each category and the total number of risks in each category. This graph helps you compare the inherent risk scores for the different categories so that you can identify which risk categories pose the most inherent risk for your organization. For example, in the graph below, the Operational &amp; Infrastructure category poses the highest inherent risk. You can use this information to focus your compliance efforts on helping to mitigate risks within that category.\u00a0<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCM+Risk+Management/Risk+Dashboard/KCM_Inherent+Risk+Score+by+Category+Graph.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCM+Risk+Management/Risk+Dashboard/KCM_Inherent+Risk+Score+by+Category+Graph.png' alt='Inherent Risk Score by Category PNG'></a></p>\n\n",

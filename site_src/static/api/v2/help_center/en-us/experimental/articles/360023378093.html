Follow this section to add the appropriate criteria rules to each of your remedial training Smart Groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Remedial Training - Round 1</strong></p>\n<p>Name the first remedial training Smart Group something descriptive of its purpose, such as \u201cRemedial Training - Round 1\u201d.</p>\n<p>Add the following criteria for this Smart Group:</p>\n<table width='613'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Phish Event</strong>: User <u>must</u> have\u00a0had <u>any failures</u>\u00a0<u>more than</u> <u>0</u> time <u>on or after XX/XX/XXXX</u><strong><em>*</em></strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Training</strong>: User <u>has not</u> <u>completed</u> <u>[insert \"round 1\" remedial training assignment(s) here]</u> <u>ever</u>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span class='wysiwyg-font-size-medium'><em><strong>*If your organization is new to the KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training platform</strong>, insert the end date of your <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010347968-What-is-the-Best-Method-for-Setting-up-a-Baseline-Test-' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>baseline phishing campaign</a>, here.\u00a0<strong>If your organization currently has phishing tests in place</strong>, insert the date in which you plan to launch this remedial training plan, here.</em> </span></p>\n<p>This set of criteria creates parameters for all users who have failed a phishing security test after the baseline (or other) phishing test, and have never completed the specified training assignment.</p>\n<p>As one of our best practices for implementing the KnowBe4 platform, we suggest conducting a blind baseline phishing test to determine your organization's Phish-prone percentage. In the <strong>Phish Event</strong> criteria rule, by specifying any failures <em>after</em> the baseline test, you're omitting failures that may have taken place before users had taken any\u00a0security awareness training. See our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/225574347-Best-Practices-Guide-How-Do-I-Effectively-Integrate-KnowBe4-Into-My-Organization-' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Best Practices Guide</a> to learn more about integrating KnowBe4 into your organization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remedial Training - Round 2</strong></p>\n<p>Now, set up the second Smart Group for the users who have had an additional failure on a phishing security test <em>after</em> completing the first round of remedial training.</p>\n<p>Give the second remedial training Smart Group a descriptive name, such as \u201cRemedial Training - Round 2.\u201d</p>\n<p>Add the following criteria for this Smart Group:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>After Training</strong>: User <u>must</u> have\u00a0had <u>any failures</u> after completing: [<u><u>insert\u00a0</u></u><u>\"round 1\" training assignment(s) here]</u>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Training</strong>: User <u>has not</u> <u>completed</u> <u>[insert \"round 2\" training assignment(s) here]</u> <u>ever</u><em><strong>**</strong></em>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span class='wysiwyg-font-size-medium'><em><strong>**</strong>Or, use \"on or after XX/XX/XXXX\" (the date you entered for the \"Remedial Training - Round 1\" Smart Group, as explained <a href='#StepOneTraining' target='_self'>above</a>).</em> </span></p>\n<p>This criteria set creates parameters for users who failed a phishing test again, after taking the first round of remedial training.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Training</strong> criteria rule takes into consideration that users have not completed the assignment(s) included in the second round of remedial training. It is important to include the\u00a0<strong>Training</strong> rule because this parameter will automatically remove users from this Smart Group once they complete their second round of remedial training.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remedial Training - Round 3, 4, etc.</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow can be continued to create as many remedial training Smart Groups as you feel necessary.</p>\n<p>When deciding how many additional groups you should create, consider the following:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>How frequently you're phishing your users<a name='Campaign_and_group_table'></a>\n</li>\n<li>How often you'd like to re-evaluate the content you're assigning, to replace it with new content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Refer to the table below to create additional remedial training Smart Groups.</p>\n<table class='' cellpadding='10'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=''><strong>Remedial Training Campaign Title</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p class=''><strong>Smart Group Title</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p class=''><strong>Smart Group Criteria</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n<p>\u00a0Remedial Round 1</p>\n\n</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n<p class=''>Remedial Training- Round 1</p>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Phish Event</strong>: User <u>must</u> have had\u00a0<u>any failures</u>\u00a0<u>more than</u> <span class='wysiwyg-underline'><u>0</u> time <span class='wysiwyg-underline'>on or after\u00a0<u>XX/XX/XXXX</u>* </span></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Training: </strong>User <u>has not</u> <u>completed</u> all of [<span class='wysiwyg-underline'>insert \"Remedial Round 1\" training assignment(s)] <u>ever</u>** </span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n<p>\u00a0Remedial Round 2</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n\n<p>Remedial Training- Round 2</p>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>After Training</strong>: User <span class='wysiwyg-underline'>must have had <span class='wysiwyg-underline'>any failures after completing: [<span class='wysiwyg-underline'>insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 1\u201d campaign] </span></span></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Training</strong>: User <u>has not</u> <u>completed</u> <u>all</u> of [<u>insert \"Remedial Round 2\" training assignment(s)</u>] <u>ever</u>**</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n\n<p>\u00a0Remedial Round 3</p>\n\n</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n\n<p>Remedial Training- Round 3</p>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>After Training</strong>: User <u>must</u> have had\u00a0<u>any failures</u>\u00a0after <u>completing</u> [<u>insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 2\u201d campaign</u>]</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Training: </strong>User <u>has not</u> <u>completed</u> <u>all</u> of [<span class='wysiwyg-underline'>insert \"Remedial Round 3\" training assignment(s)] <u>ever</u>** </span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n\n<p>\u00a0Remedial Round 4</p>\n\n</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n\n<p>Remedial Training- Round 4</p>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>After Training</strong>: User <u>must</u> have had\u00a0<u>any failures</u> after <u>completing</u> [<u>insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 3\u201d campaign</u>]</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Training</strong>: User <u>has not</u> <u>completed</u> <u>all</u> of [<span class='wysiwyg-underline'>insert \"Remedial Round 4\" training assignment(s)] <u>ever</u>** </span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n\n<p>\u00a0Remedial Round 5</p>\n\n</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n\n<p>Remedial Training- Round 5</p>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>After Training</strong>: User <u>must</u> have had\u00a0<u>any failures</u> after <u>completing</u> [<u>insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 4\u201d campaign</u>]</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Training: </strong>User <u>has not</u> <u>completed</u> <u>all</u> of [<span class='wysiwyg-underline'>insert \"Remedial Round 5\" training assignment(s)] <u>ever</u>** </span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n<p>\u00a0Remedial Round 6</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan='2'>\n\n<p>Remedial Training- Round 6</p>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>After Training: </strong>User <u>must</u> have had\u00a0<u>any failures</u>\u00a0after <u>completing</u> [<u>insert training assignment(s) used in \u201cRemedial Round 5\u201d campaign</u>]</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Training</strong>: User <u>has not</u> <u>completed</u> <u>all</u> of [<span class='wysiwyg-underline'>insert \"Remedial Round 6\" training assignment(s)] <u>ever</u>** </span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span class='wysiwyg-font-size-medium'><em><strong>*If your organization is new to the KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training platform, </strong>insert the end date of your <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010347968-What-is-the-Best-Method-for-Setting-up-a-Baseline-Test-' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>baseline phishing campaign</a>, here.\u00a0<strong>If your organization currently has phishing tests in place, </strong>insert the date in which you plan to launch this remedial training plan, here.</em><em><strong>**</strong>Or, use \"on or after XX/XX/XXXX\" (the date you entered for the \"Remedial Training -

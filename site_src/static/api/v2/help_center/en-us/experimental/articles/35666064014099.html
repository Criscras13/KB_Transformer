      "alt": "This image is a technical flow diagram illustrating the email ingress and security validation path within a Microsoft 365 environment utilizing an external security platform.\n\n### System Components and Flow Sequencing\n\nThe diagram displays five numbered steps detailing the process, starting with external ingress and concluding with final delivery or quarantine.\n\n**Ingress and Initial Processing:**\n1.  **Entry Point:** Email flow begins with an initial envelope icon leading to the **Secure Email Gateway (Optional)** node.\n2.  **Step 1:** The flow proceeds via path **1** into the primary processing hub, **Microsoft 365** (represented by a cloud-enveloped icon).\n\n**Lateral Validation (Defend Platform):**\n3.  **Step 2 (Initial Check):** An arrow labeled **2** indicates a check initiated from **Microsoft 365** toward the external detection system, **Defend** (shaded pink block).\n4.  **Defend System Operations (Step 3):** The **Defend** system processes the data (step **3**), passing it internally to the **Security Center** node (both nodes contain server rack and globe icons). A dashed arrow labeled **Graph API** facilitates communication back from **Defend** to **Microsoft 365**.\n5.  **Step 4 (Redirection/Action):** Path **4**, labeled **SMTP Redirect**, indicates the flow returning from the external security process back into **Microsoft 365**.\n\n**Final Delivery and Disposition:**\n6.  **Step 5 (Disposition Paths):** From **Microsoft 365**, the flow splits into two disposition paths, both labeled **5**:\n    *   **Quarantine:** An arrow labeled **High Confidence Phish** leads to the **Microsoft 365 Quarantine** node (represented by a fenced envelope icon with a warning symbol).\n    *   **Delivery:** A downward arrow leads to the final destination block (shaded light blue), which represents the user environment.\n\n**User Destination Structure:**\nThe final destination block is segmented into three logical delivery points:\n*   **User Inbox** (top section, marked with a silhouette icon).\n*   **Junk Folder** (bottom-left section, marked with an 'X' folder icon).\n*   **Graymail Folder** (bottom-right section, marked with a speaker/megaphone folder icon).",

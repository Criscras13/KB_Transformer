For more information on how clicks are recorded using attachments in phishing campaigns, please see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007228048-Phishing-Campaign-Attachments-Overview'>Phishing Campaign Attachments Overview</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Each phishing email in a phishing campaign will contain a unique URL created for the user who received it so that the user's click can be recorded and their respective <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010178267'>Phish-prone Percentage</a> and <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/33963203317395'>personal Risk Score</a> can be updated.</p>\n<p>So, if the user forwards the email to their IT team or a coworker and one of those individuals clicks it instead, the click is still recorded for the original recipient of the email, not the person who clicked.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>Phishing Security Test (PST) clicks will stop updating after 10 clicks.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HS1K2KHAJ6F3HC4S18JGW7JB'>Can I remove clicks?</h2>\n<p>Yes!

Remove clicks immediately when you believe they are not accurate to keep an accurate log of your user, group, and organizational Risk Scores.\u00a0</p>",

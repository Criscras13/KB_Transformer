  "body": "<p>In this article, you will learn how to integrate Palo Alto Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) with SecurityCoach. Once the integration is complete, data provided by Palo Alto NGFW will be available in the <strong>SecurityCoach</strong> tab of your KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training (KSAT) console. This data can be viewed in SecurityCoach reports and can be used to create detection rules for real-time coaching campaigns.

    "body": "<p>From the <strong>Webhook</strong> subtab of your PhishER Settings, you can create webhooks to connect your PhishER platform to other platforms you use. A webhook, also known as an HTTP push API, is a way for an application to provide another application with real-time information. When messages are triggered by specific PhishER actions, webhooks allow you to send data from the messages to another application.</p>\n<p>After you integrate webhooks with your PhishER platform, you can create a PhishER action and select the <strong>Send to Webhook</strong> option. This option allows PhishER to send the reported messages that are affected by that action to your organization\u2019s webhook. After the action is triggered, you can click a related message in your PhishER <strong>Inbox</strong> and view which webhook the message is being sent to.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'><div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> If you use Tines, you can set up webhooks to send a message to your Tines platform any time a user reports an email using the Phish Alert Button (PAB).

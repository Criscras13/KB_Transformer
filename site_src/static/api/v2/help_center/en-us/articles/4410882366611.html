Then, your IT security team can then take effective action to prevent security or network compromise.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>The User Comments and Email Disposition feature is available for the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/7142051893011-Microsoft-Outlook-EXE-Version-Phish-Alert-Button-PAB-Product-Manual'>EXE Phish Alert Button</a>, <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/14701808484627-Hybrid-Phish-Alert-Button-PAB-Product-Manual'>Hybrid Phish Alert Button</a>, Microsoft 365 (Outlook 2016 or above, Outlook Web Access), Microsoft Exchange (2013 or above), and <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047563854'>Gmail Phish Alert Button (PAB) Add-on</a>. This feature supports localized text entries.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Read the sections below to learn how to enable this feature, how this feature works, and how your users can use this feature in their inboxes.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HSE56XBKEAHG9C90MVCPSCPK'>Enabling User Comments and Email Disposition</h2>\n<p>To allow your users to send comments and decide the email\u2019s disposition, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your KnowBe4 console and navigate to your <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/226457887'>Account Settings</a> screen. This screen will look different depending on your account version. For more information, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/208969608#ENABLING'>Enable and Configure</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/208969608'>Phish Alert Button (PAB) Product Manual</a>.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Account Integrations</strong> &gt; <strong>Phish Alert</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Enable Phish Alert</strong> check box.</li>\n<li>If a Phish Alert instance does not exist, click the green <strong>Add Phish Alert Instance</strong> button.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Allow users to leave comments and disposition</strong> check box.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='h_01HSE56XBKC5WY09TWDSE9JRYD'>Email Disposition</h2>\n<p>When your users click the PAB to report an email, the sidebar will include options to suggest the disposition of the email. The possible dispositions are <strong>Phishing or Suspicious</strong>, <strong>Spam or Junk</strong>, and <strong>Unknown</strong>. For more information about each of these dispositions, see the list below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Phishing or Suspicious</strong>: These emails are sent by cybercriminals to entice you to click on a link or to give up personal or sensitive information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Spam or Junk</strong>: These emails are typically sent from companies trying to sell your users a product or service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Unknown</strong>: Your users can select this option if they are unsure whether an email is a phish or spam. This is the default setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can change the dispositions that your users see by customizing the disposition labels and descriptions. To customize the dispositions, navigate to the <strong>Languages</strong> section of your <strong>Account Settings</strong>. Open the language drop-down menu for the language used for the PAB instance. Then, enter your preferred labels in the <strong>Phishing or Suspicious Label</strong>, <strong>Spam or Junk Label</strong>, and <strong>Unknown Label</strong> fields. To display the disposition descriptions to your users, turn on the toggles next to the disposition label fields. Then, you can replace the default description text with your preferred text in the description fields. When your users click the PAB, the sidebar will display the disposition options with your customized labels and descriptions.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>You can customize the existing dispositions, but you can\u2019t create new dispositions. The PAB will recognize which default disposition corresponds to a customized disposition and provide that information when the email is forwarded to PhishER or your submission email.</div>\n</div>\n<p>You can also set different email addresses as recipients based on the disposition that your users select. For example, you can specify one email address to receive spam emails and another email address to receive emails that your users suspect are malicious. To set a recipient, enter email addresses in the fields under <strong>Send Dispositioned Email to</strong>.Users are not required to suggest a disposition when using the Phish Alert Button.

This text box can be used to explain any potential red flags that your users noticed in the email. These comments can help your security team get a better understanding of what indicators they should look out for when reviewing the reported emails. Users are not required to add a comment when using the Phish Alert Button.</p>\n<p>When your users submit user comments, you can either view the comments in PhishER or in the PAB notification emails. In the PAB notification emails, the user comments will be attached as a .json file and displayed in the <strong>User Comments</strong> section.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FreeTools/PAB/User+Comments+%26+Disposition/PAB_User+Comment+Email.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FreeTools/PAB/User+Comments+%26+Disposition/PAB_User+Comment+Email.png' alt='User Comment Notification Email'></a></p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>PAB notification emails will be forwarded to the email addresses that are specified in the <strong>Send Non-Simulated Emails to:</strong> setting in your <strong>Account Settings</strong>.

Using PhishER, you can further categorize suspicious emails and determine if these emails are legitimate.</p>\n<p>In PhishER, the <strong>Phishing or Suspicious</strong> and <strong>Spam or Junk </strong>dispositions will appear as tags on individual emails. You can use these tags to separate your users' suggested dispositions from other tags in PhishER. The word <strong>User:</strong> will appear in front of the <strong>Phishing or Suspicious</strong> and <strong>Spam or Junk</strong> tags. No tag will appear for an email that is reported as <strong>Unknown</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can view all user comments in the <strong>Discussions</strong> tab on the right side of the <strong>Message Details</strong> page. Each user comment will appear in the corresponding email, along with the user's name.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FreeTools/PAB/User+Comments+%26+Disposition/PAB_User+Comment+in+PhishER.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FreeTools/PAB/User+Comments+%26+Disposition/PAB_User+Comment+in+PhishER.png' alt='Viewing User Comments in PhishER'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01HSE56XBKXMVJPQT5G56MS69T'>Microsoft Integration</h2>\n<p>If your organization uses Microsoft Defender for Office 365, you can send reported emails to Microsoft.

Email summary pages are accessed by clicking on Defend banners.</p>\n<p>However, if you are already using phish reporting mechanisms from KnowBe4 and Microsoft, we recommend hiding the Defend buttons to remove confusion. If you do not already have a reporting mechanism, the Defend reporting buttons should be enabled.</p>\n<p>To hide the Defend reporting button on the summary page, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Defend console.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>\n<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Summary Page</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Use the <strong>Display Report Phish/Not Phish Option</strong> drop-down menu to select <strong>Hide report phish/not phish</strong>.</li>\n<li>Scroll to the top of the page and select <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>\n</ol>",

    "body": "<p>KnowBe4's <strong>PhishER</strong> is a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform that manages emails that your users report. Using PhishER, your organization can identify potential email threats to strengthen your security measures and defense-in-depth plan.</p>\n<p>PhishER is available as a standalone platform but it works best when combined with the KSAT console. PhishER can also integrate with third-party analysis tools like VirusTotal and Syslog to provide your organization with security scans and evaluations.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>To view a PhishER product demo, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000937648.html'>KnowBe4 Product Demos</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='iv_01H7JX0632C1Q5MZHSV57X54CC'>PhishER Workflow</h2>\n<p>Below is a diagram of the PhishER workflow. We recommend reviewing this workflow before getting started so you can better understand PhishER.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/GettingStarted/QuickstartGuide/PhishER_Process_Expanded.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/GettingStarted/QuickstartGuide/PhishER_Process_Expanded.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<p>For more information about this workflow, see the list below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When your users report suspicious emails, the emails are sent to the PhishER <strong>Inbox</strong>.</li>\n<li>Using your customized rules, PhishER analyzes the email components for malicious content or red flags. Then, PhishER assigns tags to emails that meet your rule criteria.</li>\n<li>Tags trigger PhishER to perform your specific actions. Based on your organization's customized rules and actions, PhishER will automatically disposition each email. Dispositioning helps you prioritize reported emails and respond quickly to real phishing attacks.</li>\n<li>If you have enabled the PhishER Blocklist, you can use information about malicious or spam emails to block similar emails from reaching your users' inboxes. If you have a PhishER Plus subscription and have enabled the Global Blocklist, you can use crowd-sourced information to block similar emails.</li>\n<li>If you have enabled PhishRIP, you can remove similar malicious or spam emails that have reached your users' inboxes already. If you have a PhishER Plus subscription and have enabled Global PhishRIP, you can use crowd-sourced information to remove similar emails.</li>\n<li>If you have enabled PhishFlip, you can reuse reported emails to create KSAT phishing templates and campaigns. PhishFlip removes malicious elements from the reported emails before sending phishing tests to your users.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id='iv_01H7JX0632T8RVP55CXTR7F4HN'>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>When using PhishER and KSAT together, you will need to purchase the same number of seats for both products. If you purchase additional seats for either product during your subscription term, you will need to purchase seats for the other products as well.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong>Additional minimum subscription purchasing requirements may apply.</div>\n</div>\n<p>All PhishER customers will need to have an email forwarding system so that all users' reported emails can be forwarded to your PhishER <strong>Inbox</strong> for analysis. We recommend that you install the Phish Alert Button (PAB) for your organization, but you also have the option to allow your users to manually forward emails to a reporting email address. For more information about these methods, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/208969608.html'>Phish Alert Button (PAB) Product Manual</a> and <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360013919314.html'>PhishER Settings</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='iv_01H7JX0632ZN5X29DZX4S6G9PK'>Creating Your Account</h2>\n<p>First, you'll need to create a PhishER account.</p>\n<p>To create your account, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your KnowBe4 account.</li>\n<li>Click your name at the top-right corner of the page.

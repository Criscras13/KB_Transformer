See our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000727248' target='_self'>Policy Management Module Guide</a> guide for more information.</div>\n</div>\n<p>This article explains how to manage the user groups that will complete tasks for your risk management or compliance management controls. Before you begin, please see the <a href='#USINGUSERGROUPS' target='_self'>How Do I Use User Groups?</a> section below.</p>\n<p><a name='USINGUSERGROUPS'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J82V4GZWN8ERC6NBNBTN59CW'>How Do I Use User Groups?</h2>\n<p>The first step is to create a user group and assign a user as the Group Lead. Then, you'll assign the user group to one or more controls. Assigning a user group to a control allows you to delegate task assignments and task evidence approvals to the Group Lead. Users\u00a0who are assigned as a Group Lead have special permissions allowing them to reassign tasks to another user in their group. To learn more about user permissions and user roles, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015826148-KCM-GRC-User-Roles' target='_self'>User Roles Guide</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are a few things you should know about assigning a user group to a control:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>When evidence is required for a task under this control, the Group Lead must approve the evidence before the task can be closed.\u00a0\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>The Group Lead is notified once evidence has been submitted for a task. To learn more, see <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052578153-KCM-GRC-Email-Notifications-and-the-Email-Digest#CONTROL-NOTIFICATIONS' target='_self'>Control Task Notifications</a>.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When creating task schedules or one-time tasks for the control, you must select one of the users from that group to be the User Assigned for the task. This means users who are not in the group cannot be assigned to task schedules for that control.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>The user who is assigned to the control's task schedule(s) will receive task reminder notifications from KCM GRC To learn more, see <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052578153-KCM-GRC-Email-Notifications-and-the-Email-Digest#CONTROL-NOTIFICATIONS' target='_self'>Control Task Notifications</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tasks must be completed by the User Assigned for the task.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Group Leads or other group members cannot complete a task that is assigned to someone else unless they have a user role that allows them to do so, such as Scope Administrator. To learn more about user permissions, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015826148' target='_self'>User Roles Guide</a>.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A Group Lead can reassign tasks for this control to another member in their user group.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Group members can view all tasks that are created for the control that their group is assigned to.

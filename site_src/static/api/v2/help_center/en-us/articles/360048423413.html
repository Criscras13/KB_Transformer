    "body": "<p>To learn about this product, please read the below tutorial.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HF53SR9E4RZDCG231AWBZ55J'>What is the Browser Password Inspector?</h2>\n<p>The Browser Password Inspector is a free tool that checks the computers in your Active Directory for threats related to passwords stored in browsers.</p>\n<p>The BPI will connect to each available computer in your AD and will attempt to retrieve any passwords saved in Chrome, Firefox, and new versions of Edge. Any found passwords will be hashed (using NT hash), and the hash will be encrypted and sent to the machine on which BPI is installed. The tool then compares these password hashes against the domain password hashes to determine if there is any match. Then it will compare the same hashes with the ones from a weak password database to check for weak web passwords. The results will be represented as a yes or no value.</p>\n<p>The results will display which users are using, and saving, their domain passwords in browsers, the reuse of passwords across multiple websites, and if there are weak passwords saved in browsers. The report will also show the different ways the passwords are being used and the number of times the passwords were stored and used. The results will be grouped by the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and new versions of Edge.</p>\n<p>Results are presented in two forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the user interface of the product</li>\n<li>As a PDF report</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the user interface, results are displayed using graphical elements for a quick overview of the most important findings, and a table which presents the details for each domain user who was found to save passwords in browsers.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/BPI/BPI+Screenshots/BPI+1+video+(1).gif'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/BPI/BPI+Screenshots/BPI+1+video+(1).gif' alt='BPI Results Page'></a></p>\n<p>In the PDF report results related to each individual user will be grouped by the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of unique passwords stored and used</li>\n<li>The age of the stored password</li>\n<li>The browser that password is stored in</li>\n<li>The similarity of the passwords used</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01HF53SR9EJYNNAP28APEBYWB5'>Is My Information Safe?</h2>\n<p>Yes. It's important to note that this tool will never display or report the actual passwords of any user accounts in your AD. Passwords within AD are in a hashed format and will never be visible at any point. The test results will simply identify the user accounts which failed the test so you can decide how to correct that.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the data pulled from the scanned machines is encrypted. The information obtained during the test is saved in local memory, not to disk. The only information returned to KnowBe4 is a total count of the machines scanned during the test.</p>\n<p>BPI deploys software agents to the targeted machines to complete its testing. The agents are installed before the scan and removed after the scan is complete, so they don't remain on the machines.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HF53SR9E0CFKTY7F19XK984A'>System Requirements</h2>\n<p>To run the Browser Password Inspector, the system you use must have the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft Windows 10 (64-bit), or a newer version</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2016, or a newer version</li>\n<li>2 GB RAM</li>\n<li>Internet connection</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id='h_01HF53SR9E0CSABBC8QVY9NT94'>Installation and Setup</h2>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important: </strong><span>This test will </span><strong>only</strong><span> work on Windows machines that are connected to the internet.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign up for your Browser Password Inspector by navigating to the <a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/free-cybersecurity-tools/browser-password-inspector' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Browser Password Inspector</a> home page.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/wpt/WPT.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/wpt/WPT.png' alt='Sign up page asking for information'></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Upon signing up, we will email you a unique License Key, which you'll need to enter prior to running the test.</li>\n<li>Download and run the installer file for the Browser Password Inspector.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FreeTools/BPI/BPI01.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/FreeTools/BPI/BPI01.png' alt='Download the installer file'></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Review and agree to the License Agreement and then click <strong>Install</strong> to complete the installation.</li>\n<li>Launch Browser Password Inspector.

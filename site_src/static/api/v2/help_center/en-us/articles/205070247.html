A needle indicates the current score, displayed numerically beneath the gauge as **23.7**.\n*   **Contextual Information:** A footnote below the gauge reads: \"See our **Virtual Risk Officer (VRO) Guide** for details about how Risk Scores are calculated.\" (VRO Guide is a hyperlink).\n*   **Risk History Chart:** A line graph titled \"Risk History,\" subtitled, \"This Risk Score combines the risk score of all users in this group.\"\n    *   The Y-axis is labeled \"Risk Score\" (0 to 100).\n    *   The X-axis displays a timeline spanning approximately March 2020 through August 2020.\n    *   The chart displays a step line representing the historical risk score, fluctuating between roughly 15 and 30.\n\n**2. User Management Controls:**\nBelow the score visualizations, a section titled **Users** provides filtering and data export controls for user lists (though the list itself is not visible):\n\n*   **Filters (Dropdowns):**\n    *   Status: Set to **Active**\n    *   Type: Set to **All**\n    *   Groups: Set to **All**\n*   **Actions/Tools:**\n    *   A link labeled **Download CSV** (with a green download icon).\n    *   A search bar labeled \"Search by email or name...\"\n    *   A search icon (magnifying glass) and a settings/gear icon are positioned to the right of the search field.",

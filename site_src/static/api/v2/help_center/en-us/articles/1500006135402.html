    "body": "<p>Some compliance and security regulation frameworks require that your organization has certain policies in place. To assist in the process of creating new policies, your KCM GRC account offers policy templates that you can download and customize for your organization.</p>\n<p>KCM GRC's policy templates are designed to incorporate some of the Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, as defined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision 5. NIST SP 800-53 is a collection of security standards and guidelines that are collectively referred to as \"controls\". The NIST SP 800-53 controls were originally created for federal information systems, but this collection of controls has become a common standard that organizations use to become compliant with many regulating frameworks. To learn more about these NIST controls, you can find the official publication here: <a href='https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf' target='_self'>NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations</a>.</p>\n<p>See the sections below to learn more about KCM GRC's policy templates.</p>\n<p><a name='TEMPLATESPAGE'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01HAWDMQWK4S8580R4T3RY5GYG'>The Policy Templates Page</h2>\n<p>To see the templates that KCM GRC has to offer, navigate to the <strong>Policy Templates</strong> page in your account.

For example, if NIST redefines the controls found in SP 800-53, our policy templates will be updated as necessary. If updates are made to the templates, the <strong>Updated Date</strong> column will show the date that changes were made. The updated templates will also be noted on the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014817147' target='_self'>KCM GRC Change Log</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>cloud</strong> icon in this column to download the policy template.\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>The policy template will download to your machine as a DOCX file.

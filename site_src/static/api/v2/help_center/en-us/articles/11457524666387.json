    "body": "<p>Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack where cybercriminals send a follow-up email to a legitimate email from a trusted sender. In the follow-up email, the cybercriminals claim that the sender forgot to include a link or attachment in the original email. However, the follow-up email isn\u2019t from the original sender but is actually from a cybercriminal, and the link or attachment is malicious.</p>\n<p>To help your users learn about this type of attack, you can create a clone phishing test. You can use your PhishER platform and KSAT console together to mimic clone phishing attacks.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HSBNN54XHT19F632XFQJJP31'>Create a Phishing Template with PhishER</h2>\n<p>We recommend creating a clone phishing template by using a real email that your users have reported. Using a real reported email can make the follow-up email seem more legitimate and can help your users understand how cybercriminals might use this type of attack.</p>\n<p>To create a phishing template with PhishER, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>In your PhishER platform, navigate to the <strong>Inbox </strong>page.</li>\n<li>Select the check box next to the message you want to use to create your clone phishing template.\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> If you find an email that is in your email inbox but not in your PhishER Inbox, report the email using the Phish Alert Button (PAB) or send the EML file to one of your PhishER reporting addresses. The email will be sent to PhishER, where you will be able to use PhishFlip to create a phishing template.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Run</strong> drop-down menu at the top-left corner of the page.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Create KSAT Template</strong> option. This option will remove all the malicious links and attachments from the original template. Then, this template will be added to the <strong>PhishFlip</strong> category under the <strong>My Templates</strong> section in your KSAT console.\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>You can also create a KSAT template on the <strong>Message Details</strong> page or the <strong>Actions</strong> tab.

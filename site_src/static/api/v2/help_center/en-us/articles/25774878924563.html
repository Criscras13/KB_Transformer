We're committed to providing a user community experience that is harassment-free and an opportunity for all participants to collaborate, learn, participate, and network in an environment that is productive and respectful. We expect members to act professionally, and to interact and communicate in ways that are appropriate for a professional audience from diverse backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Behaviors inconsistent with these expectations include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Harassment, conduct, language, or other action inappropriate for a professional setting that negatively refers to a participants age, physical or mental disability, race, color, ethnicity or national origin, sex, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, physical appearance, religious belief, marital status, or military or veteran status.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Harassment and problematic conduct may include offensive comments (including through jokes and imagery), sexual images or nudity visible to others, deliberate intimidation, stalking, attempts to identify members who have not shared their personal identity (including \u2018doxing\u2019), recording, sustained disruption of discussions and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HNG00P8K46JDPQS441P0Z4AK'>Guidelines for Members</h3>\n<p>For all interactions utilizing the KnowBe4 Community, we expect participants to abide by our Code of Conduct to ensure the community is productive and respectful. The following guidelines will further help ensure we maintain an inclusive environment for all:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be respectful to others.</li>\n<li>Avoid conflicts and arguments.</li>\n<li>Use common sense, kindness, and consideration together with the guidelines outlined.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01HNG014KE7Y7R48WZAQ6X7QA7'>Social Media and Privacy</h3>\n<p>The KnowBe4 Community is intended for positive professional discussion in a semi-confidential environment. Only active KnowBe4 customers are invited to participate. Users have a reasonable expectation of privacy as they are sharing questions, experiences, and recommendations related to their own professional experiences. Therefore, we insist that all members of the community respect the privacy of others and refrain from sharing what could be potentially confidential information from other users. This includes copying data, identifying information, screenshots, or other information shared by others within the community. Sharing of this information in any public forum, particularly social media, is considered a violation of our Code of Conduct.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HNG01H0X4S99DAHT2T85EDMC'>Enforcement</h3>\n<p>If a participant engages in behavior that doesn't comply with the above-mentioned expectations, KnowBe4 may take any action that we deem appropriate, including warning the member, limiting the members ability to comment, suspending or expelling the member entirely from the community, informing the member\u2019s employer, and referring the matter to local authorities in response to extreme and potentially unlawful behavior. Participants asked to stop harassing or other unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. If the participant is a KnowBe4 employee, KnowBe4 also reserves the right to take full disciplinary action pursuant to our internal policies.</p>\n<p>Please note that while we take all concerns raised seriously, we'll use our discretion to determine when and how to follow up on reported incidents, and may decline to take any further action, and/or may direct the participant to other resources to address concern.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HNG01KK0W8D0FEXV6BJ3DC12'>Reporting an Issue</h3>\n<p>If you feel that the behavior of a member or members or a topic/discussion is not adhering to these expectations, please contact the KnowBe4 Community team at <a href='mailto:community@knowbe4.com'>community@knowbe4.com</a> with a description of the situation and preferably a link to the specific conversation that violates this Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your contribution and participation in the KnowBe4 Community! We thank you for doing your part to create an environment where all participants can collaborate, learn and network productively.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HNFZYJF9KB70K78CA8WYVPTG'>Website Terms of Use</h2>\n<p><a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/website-terms-of-use'>https://www.knowbe4.com/website-terms-of-use</a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01HNFZYN364FZC47QAVZN4M48W'>Website Privacy Notice</h2>\n<p><a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/website-privacy-notice'>https://www.knowbe4.com/website-privacy-notice</a></p>",

How does KnowBe4 protect my data?</h3>\n<p>Your data stays protected since everything, including all verification for PasswordIQ, is handled by the client on your local computer. Any data that PasswordIQ uses is never uploaded to a KnowBe4 server.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1Y68ST5CKPAMMF8GBW'>2. Can I view the passwords of users that were detected to have vulnerabilities?</h3>\n<p>No. The passwords that the client scans are hashed, so PasswordIQ can't access your users' passwords. Your scan results are based on the password-related settings and password hashes in your AD.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1Y1DTBDK5A48KT25DN'>3. Can KnowBe4 see users\u2019 passwords?</h3>\n<p>No. Hashed passwords are a long combination of letters and numbers that are in place to disguise an actual password. KnowBe4 can\u2019t find out what your users\u2019 passwords are from the hashed text.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YQ7JZSP2MDQZ647HP'>4. Can I install the client on my domain controller?</h3>\n<p>We recommend that you don't install the client on your domain controller. If you install the client on a domain controller, you'll need to allow the service account to log in to the computer locally. For computers that are not domain controllers, you won't have to allow the service account to log in to the computer locally.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the scan process may generate high network traffic and computer processing unit (CPU) usage, which can interfere with your domain controller's processes.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YNYSXYCBG9JCCR8BQ'>5. Can I install the client on a different computer than the client is installed on?</h3>\n<p>Yes. However, you'll need to uninstall the client on its current computer before you install it on the new computer.</p>\n<p>To uninstall the client on its current computer and install it on the new computer, follow the instructions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the computer that currently runs the client, open the <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under the <strong>Programs</strong> section, click the <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> link.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>KnowBe4 PasswordIQ</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Uninstall</strong> button.</li>\n<li>In the pop-up window, click the <strong>Yes</strong> button to keep your configuration files.\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div>\n<strong>Important:</strong>This step will save your API token, last scan summary, and proxy server settings. If your configuration files contain proxy server settings, the new computer will need to have the same proxy server settings as the current computer.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>After the uninstallation completes, open the <strong>File Explorer</strong> application on the new computer.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>%WINDIR%\\Temp</strong> folder.</li>\n<li>Copy the <strong>pqServerDataDirUninstallBk</strong> folder.</li>\n<li>Transfer the <strong>pqServerDataDirUninstallBk </strong>folder to the <strong>%WINDIR%\\Temp</strong> path of the new computer. For some potential methods that you could use to transfer this folder, see the list below:\n<ul>\n<li>Paste the folder to a network drive or another drive that you can access from the new computer. Then, from the new computer, copy and paste the folder to the <strong>%WINDIR%\\Temp</strong> path.</li>\n<li>Paste the folder to a cloud storage service that you can access from the new computer. Then, from the new computer, copy and paste the folder to the <strong>%WINDIR%\\Temp</strong> path.</li>\n<li>Email the folder to yourself, and sign in to your email on the new computer. Then, from the new computer, copy and paste the folder to the <strong>%WINDIR%\\Temp</strong> path.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In a new window, log in to your KSAT console and navigate to PasswordIQ.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Download PasswordIQ client</strong> button to begin installing the client on the new computer.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YTG2MHES5RG7R4MZE'>6. I have multiple AD domains in my organization. Can I add these domains to the same client?</h3>\n<p>No. You'll need to install one instance of the client for each domain so that each domain name can be tracked separately. If you encounter errors or issues with the client, individual domain tracking will help our support team troubleshoot any issues with your AD.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YGPN3NS3F19FZA6XT'>7. Can I create a different scan schedule for each of my domains?</h3>\n<p>No. You can only create one scan schedule. Your scan schedule will initiate scans for all of the domains that are connected to PasswordIQ.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4411080243731.html'>Running Scans from Your Dashboard</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4411080243731.html'>PasswordIQ Dashboard Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YKC64NB68SPG3Q2B2'>8. Since I can run scans from KSAT, do I need to keep the client installed on my computer?</h3>\n<p>Yes. While you can initiate scans from the PasswordIQ tab of your KSAT console, you'll need to keep the client to continue running scans. The client is used to scan your AD.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YVSY8A1VF851NZXEF'>9. Why does PasswordIQ require a service account with more permissions than ADI?</h3>\n<p>The service account for PasswordIQ needs to be able to access information about your users' password security, including password hashes, from AD. The <strong>Replicating Directory Changes </strong>and <strong>Replicating Directory Changes All </strong>allow the account to request this information. These permissions are higher than the service account requires for <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/228373888.html'>ADI</a>, which only requires permissions for performing LDAP queries.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YPVTWE4DEGPQ685MM'>10. Does PasswordIQ scan AD accounts that are disabled?</h3>\n<p>No. PasswordIQ will only scan active AD accounts.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YT47TZYSHVKMM1ZPD'>11. Does PasswordIQ scan AD accounts that don't have KSAT accounts?</h3>\n<p>Yes. PasswordIQ will scan all active AD accounts and display the results, so your users don't need to have KSAT accounts to be included in scans. For more information about filtering your scan results, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4411080243731.html'>PasswordIQ Dashboard Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1Y3KRV7473ABK6A2WE'>12. What data does PasswordIQ read from AD?</h3>\n<p>PasswordIQ uses a third-party library that utilizes Microsoft's APIs to compare hashes from your AD.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div>\n<strong>Note:</strong>PasswordIQ does not save any information from your AD.</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Deleted</li>\n<li>Description</li>\n<li>DisplayName</li>\n<li>DistinguishedName</li>\n<li>Enabled</li>\n<li>GUID</li>\n<li>GivenName</li>\n<li>KeyCredentials</li>\n<li>LMHash</li>\n<li>LMHashHistory</li>\n<li>LastLogonTimestamp</li>\n<li>LogonName</li>\n<li>Mail</li>\n<li>NTHash</li>\n<li>NTHashHistory</li>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>OperatingSystem</li>\n<li>PasswordLastChanged</li>\n<li>PrimaryGroupID</li>\n<li>ProxyAddresses</li>\n<li>RoamedCredentials</li>\n<li>RoamedCredentials Modified</li>\n<li>RoamedCredentialsCreated</li>\n<li>SAMAccountName</li>\n<li>SAMAccountType</li>\n<li>SID</li>\n<li>SIDHistory</li>\n<li>SecurityDescriptor</li>\n<li>ServicePrincipalName</li>\n<li>SupplementalCredentials</li>\n<li>Surname</li>\n<li>UserAccountControl</li>\n<li>UserPrincipalName</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If PIQ finds any vulnerabilities, it will create a list with the vulnerable users\u2019 names, email addresses, and specific vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1Y469SEGSEZEGFGV9N'>13. What is the 175 MB .bin file used for?</h3>\n<p>The 175 MB data.bin file is a list of weak passwords used for detecting the Weak Password vulnerability. After you download the PasswordIQ client, this file will download to your computer. PasswordIQ scans through this file along with an online database. The online database is also used by KnowBe4\u2019s Breached Password Test (BPT) free tool.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YW2Y3TN7RAS6N1809'>14. How does the breached password test in PasswordIQ work?</h3>\n<p>All passwords found in the databases get hashed, which is a form of encryption. The client compares the hashed passwords from the databases with the hashed passwords for the domains for each user found in your Active Directory (AD). If there is a match, the user gets flagged for having a breached password.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YJEC5N66VSEG7EQC4'>15. Where do you get your breach data from? Can I see it?</h3>\n<p>We get our data for breached passwords in PasswordIQ through our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360001508408.html'>Breached Password Test (BPT) </a>database, which is a compilation of multiple sources on the internet and not a public database. We update our data on breached passwords once a month. For privacy and security purposes, the BPT database is proprietary information.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1YBXCV78XEH5AYVE9G'>16. Why doesn\u2019t PasswordIQ work with Azure?</h3>\n<p>Azure uses a different hash than PasswordIQ to store its passwords. There isn\u2019t an existing API that allows PasswordIQ to extract Azure\u2019s hashes.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01J7BNVETQWK2PEH3Y2QZA2NGD'>17. Can I add a list of custom weak passwords to PasswordIQ?</h3>\n<p>Yes! Open the data.bin file in the PasswordIQ agent's install directory with a text editor, then add the custom weak passwords you want.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JH8AFVGYFCV27MRDAXJMCDXQ'>18. What ports does PasswordIQ use?</h3>\n<p>PasswordIQ uses LDAP port 389 and SMB port 445. Currently, PasswordIQ isn\u2019t compatible with LDAPS port 636.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS91RV1YV30BPBMGK99931S5'>Viewing Your Scan Results</h2>\n<p>For information about viewing your scan results, click the links below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href='#h_01HS91RV1ZSHGBS6REQP6EJ3H7'>What should I do after I receive my scan results?</a></li>\n<li><a href='#h_01HS91RV1Z0ET0SNQ91JGW0MWP'>How do I change my default dashboard?</a></li>\n<li><a href='#h_01HS91RV1ZDAH9RA8CWB9W067F'>I changed the status of a user's vulnerability to Resolved.

Do they all have the same password? </a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1ZSHGBS6REQP6EJ3H7'>1. What should I do after I receive my scan results?</h3>\n<p>You can use your scan results to review and resolve your users' vulnerabilities and to reduce your organization\u2019s vulnerability to cyberattacks. To review and resolve your users' vulnerabilities, we recommend that you follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>User Table</strong> widget of the PasswordIQ dashboard, review the vulnerabilities that were found for each user.</li>\n<li>Change the status of each vulnerability to <strong>Reviewed</strong>. For more information about changing vulnerability statuses, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4411080243731.html'>User Table</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4411080243731.html'>PasswordIQ Dashboard Guide</a>.</li>\n<li>Help resolve your users' password vulnerabilities. For recommendations about resolving each vulnerability, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4413383900435.html'>Resolve Password Vulnerabilities</a> article.</li>\n<li>After an administrator or user resolves each vulnerability, change the status of the vulnerability to <strong>Resolved</strong>. For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4411080243731.html'>User Table</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4411080243731.html'>PasswordIQ Dashboard Guide</a>.</li>\n<li>Run a new scan to confirm that the vulnerabilities have been resolved. For more information, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4406004172435.html'>Running Scans</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4406004172435.html'>PasswordIQ Product Manual</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1Z0ET0SNQ91JGW0MWP'>2. How do I change my default dashboard?</h3>\n<p>To change your default dashboard, follow the instructions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your KSAT account and select the <strong>Password IQ</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>In the top-left corner of the page, click the name of your current default dashboard to open a drop-down menu.</li>\n<li>Select the dashboard that you would like to set as your default dashboard.</li>\n<li>In the top-right corner of the page, click the <strong>Set as Default</strong> button.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1ZDAH9RA8CWB9W067F'>3. I changed the status of a user's vulnerability to <strong>Resolved</strong>.</h3>\n<p>Why did the status revert back to <strong>New</strong>? Most likely, another scan has run since you changed the status of the vulnerability. This change also indicates that the user's vulnerability has not been resolved in your AD account. If the vulnerability cannot be resolved by an administrator, we recommend that you contact the user to help them resolve the vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HS91RV1Z26TFVJ2H7JX2KVBH'>4. Many of my users were detected for the <strong>Shared Password</strong> vulnerability. Do they all have the same password?</h3>\n<p>No. If a user is detected for the <strong>Shared Password</strong> vulnerability, the user shares a password with at least one other user in your AD account. Unless an administrator set the same password for all of the users who were detected for this vulnerability, the users most likely don't all share the same password.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HS91RV1ZG36N3VFWVVWF2VB4'>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>For troubleshooting information, click the links below.</p>\n<p><a href='#h_01HS91RV1Z3YPGTEYSXDCXC7CX'>1.

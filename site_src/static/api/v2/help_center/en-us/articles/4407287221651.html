    "body": "<p>This glossary contains terms that will help you use the Policy Management module of your KCM GRC platform. For general information about the Policy Management module, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000727248.html' target='_self'>Policy Management Module Guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a name='CAMPAIGN'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J8333CGCCPT5J219WD3YFA4Q'>Campaigns</h2>\n<p>A campaign is a feature in your platform that you can use to assign policies to your users. You can select the policies and user groups that are included in a campaign. You can also set up notifications to prompt your users to acknowledge the campaign policies. Then, you can monitor the progress of each campaign from the <strong>View Campaign</strong> page.</p>\n<p>For more information about creating and managing campaigns in the Policy Management module, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4412197267603.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage Policy Campaigns</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Campaign Notifications</strong></p>\n<p>Campaign notifications notify users or the campaign owner as the campaign progresses. When you create or update a campaign, you can select the types of notifications that a campaign sends.</p>\n<p>The types of campaign notifications are listed below.</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>On Campaign Start (User)</li>\n<li>Before Acknowledgement Due (User)</li>\n<li>On Campaign Start (Campaign Owner)</li>\n<li>Before Campaign End (Campaign Owner)</li>\n<li>On Campaign Completion (Campaign Owner)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about campaign notifications, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4412197267603.html' target='_self'>Selecting Policy Notifications</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4412197267603.html' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage Policy Campaigns</a> article.</p>\n<p><strong>Campaign Owner</strong></p>\n<p>A campaign owner is the user who creates the campaign. Depending on the notification types that the campaign owner selects for a campaign, they can receive notifications when the campaign starts, completes, and ends.</p>\n<p><a name='POLICY'></a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01J8333CGC3ZWD8JB7BPQZPVQ2'>Policies</h2>\n<p>A policy is an agreement, such as a document or standard, that users in your organization must follow. In your platform, you can upload or add a link to a policy that you will use for a campaign.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>KCM GRC offers policy templates that you can download and customize for your organization. To learn more about the policy templates that we offer, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/1500006135402.html' target='_self'>Policy Templates</a> article.\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n<p>For more information about using policies in the Policy Management module, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000727248.html' target='_self'>Step Two: Add Policies</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360000727248.html' target='_self'>Policy Management Module Guide</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy Management Groups </strong></p>\n<p>Policy Management Groups are groups that you create and assign Policy Management Users to. You can create Policy Management Groups from the <strong>Policy Management Users &amp; Groups</strong> page. Before you can send policies to Policy Management Users, you must assign them to a Policy Management Group.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about Policy Management Groups, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4412346622099.html' target='_self'>How to Add Users and Groups to the Policy Management Module</a> article.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy Management Reports</strong></p>\n<p>Policy Management Reports show the progress of each campaign in your platform. The reports are automatically created when a user creates a campaign. You can view Policy Management Reports from the <strong>Reports</strong> tab of the navigation panel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about Policy Management Reports, see the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360012357353.html' target='_self'>Policy Management Reports</a> section of our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360012357353.html' target='_self'>Metrics Reporting Guide</a> article.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Policy Management Users</strong></p>\n<p>Policy Management Users are users that you create in the Policy Management module of your platform. When you create Policy Management Users, they are not assigned licenses to KCM GRC because they are not KCM GRC users. You can add Policy Management Users to Policy Management Groups, and you can assign Policy Management Groups to policy campaigns. Then, Policy Management Users can view and acknowledge policies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information about Policy Management Users, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/4412346622099.html' target='_self'>How to Add Users and Groups to the Policy Management Module</a> article.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy Template</strong></p>\n<p>A policy template is a policy that you can download and customize from your platform. Then, you can add the customized policy to a campaign. Each policy template incorporates controls from the <a href='https://www.nist.gov' target='_self'>National Institute of Security and Technology</a>.</p>\n<p>KCM GRC policy templates cover security and privacy topics. See the list below for examples of the policy templates that KCM GRC offers.</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Media Protection Policy</li>\n<li>Mobile Device Policy</li>\n<li>Risk Assessment and Management Policy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about policy templates, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/1500006135402.html' target='_self'>Policy Templates</a> article.\u00a0</p>",

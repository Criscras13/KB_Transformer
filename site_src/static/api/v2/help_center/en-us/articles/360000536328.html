    "body": "<p>The [[domain]] placeholder, when used within phishing templates, landing pages, and training notifications, will automatically populate the domain of whoever is <strong>receiving</strong> the phishing email. The domain placeholder will work across multiple domains that are in your account.</p>\n<p>You should NOT change the [[domain]] placeholder by entering your domain within the brackets. Changing the [[domain]] placeholder directly will prevent your phishing emails from being delivered. If this happens, you'll see a bounce in your phishing reports, indicating that an error occurred and that the email address does not comply with RFC 2822, 3.6.2. If you don't want to use the recipient's domain, you can define another domain to use instead in your Account Settings.

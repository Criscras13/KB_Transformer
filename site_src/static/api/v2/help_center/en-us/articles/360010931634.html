The <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> is a quick and easy way to implement risk management using your KCM GRC platform.</p>\n<p>This guide will assist you with navigating through the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong>. See the sections below to learn more.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> See our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041154554' target='_self'>Using the Risk Wizard</a> video if you would like to watch a short video tutorial for the Risk Wizard.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='h_01HW8HHQE4VNTKR3XDH9HHY2BH'>What Is the Risk Wizard?</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> offers a simple flow of identifying and adding your organization\u2019s risks to your KCM GRC platform, so you can evaluate, mitigate, and monitor these threats.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HW8HHQE48BT1KQPFHVRGTAEK'>Master Risk Repository</h3>\n<p>You will navigate through the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> and select applicable risks from KCM GRC's offering of industry-standard risks. This collection of risks is called the Master Risk Repository. All of the risks in the Master Risk Repository were gathered from the National Institute of Standards and Techn<span>ology (NIST) Special Publication 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.</span></p>\n<p>In addition to the NIST risks that you can choose from, you can import or create custom risks while using the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong>. All of the risks you select and/or create while using the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> will be added to your KCM GRC <strong>Risk Register</strong> upon completion.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HW8HHQE4KDY27TA8C7Q9K839'>Risk Wizard Steps</h2>\n<p>After logging in to your account, navigate to the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> by clicking on <strong>Risk Management</strong>, then <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> from your navigation panel. Then, follow the steps below to complete the Risk Wizard.</p>\n<p><strong><span class='wysiwyg-font-size-large'>Step 1:</span></strong> Choose a <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> level based on your organization\u2019s familiarity and maturity with risk management. The level you choose determines the number of risks and the complexity of the risks that are offered in the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong>. Regardless of which wizard level you choose, you can add additional risks from KCM GRC's <a href='#MASTERRISKREPO' target='_self'>Master Risk Repository</a> to your <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011109733' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Risk Register</a>\u00a0manually, or from the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong>, at any time.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=''><strong>Risk Wizard Level</strong></td>\n<td class=''><strong>Description</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Core</strong></td>\n<td>The Core level includes the most common risks from the Master Risk Repository. This level is a good option if your organization is in the fundamental stages of establishing risk assessment and management processes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Moderate</strong></td>\n<td>This level expands on the core-level collection of risks from the Master Risk Repository, offering additional risks and vulnerabilities. This level is a good option if your organization is familiar with its risks, has completed risk assessments, and/or has risk management processes in place.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Advanced</strong></td>\n<td>This level offers the entire set of pre-populated risks from the Master Risk Repository. This level is a good option if your organization has completed risk assessments and has fully established risk management processes.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Use the\u00a0<strong>Select</strong> button under the appropriate level to start the Risk Wizard.</p>\n<p><span class='wysiwyg-font-size-large'><strong>Step 2:</strong></span> The <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> will begin in the Business &amp; Strategic Risks category, with a set of pre-populated risks. Use the expand arrows to the left of the slider buttons to expand each risk and view its description. Using the slider buttons, select all of the applicable risks that need to be added to your organization's <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011109733' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Risk Register</a>. You can use the <strong>Select All From This Category</strong> checkbox to select all Risks offered from the category, at that <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> level.</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>Each time you use the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> all selected risks will be added to your account. Therefore, if the selected risks have already been added to your <strong>Risk Register</strong>, this will result in duplicate risks.</div>\n</div>\n<p><span class='wysiwyg-font-size-large'><strong>Step 3:</strong></span> Repeat step two until you've reviewed and selected the applicable risks from each category in the wizard.</p>\n<p><span class='wysiwyg-font-size-large'><strong>Step 4:</strong></span> The <strong>Manual</strong> section of the <strong>Risk Wizard</strong> offers three options for adding additional risks to your <strong>Risk Register</strong>.

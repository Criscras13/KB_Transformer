Then, select the <strong>CSV Import</strong> button. Once you select this button, you can import a CSV file containing your users' email addresses along with any additional information you'd like to include about your users.</li>\n<li>Be sure to follow the formatting steps in our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204873347'>Import Users with a CSV File</a> article when adding user fields and details to your CSV file.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Manually edit a user\u2019s profile from the <strong>User Information</strong> subtab.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id='iv_01H8F001XAG1D465NJA4DZZE5E'>User Account Details</h3>\n<p>For more information about the different areas and fields in the <strong>User Information</strong> subtab, see the annotated screenshot and list below:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/user_profile/useraccountdetails_specifics2.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/user_profile/useraccountdetails_specifics2.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>User Account Details</strong>: This section shows basic account history and login data, such as how many times the user has signed in, when their confirmation email was sent, and the last IP address they used to sign in.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User Type:</strong> You can use this option to select the type of user this profile represents.

By default, PhishER will be disabled for users and enabled for admins. As an admin, you have the option to disable and re-enable your own PhishER access. If PhishER is enabled, a <strong>Go to PhishER</strong> drop-down menu option will be available by selecting your email address in the top-right corner of the KSAT console.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/phishER_acctSettings.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/PhishER/phishER_acctSettings.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-factor Authentication</strong>: You have the option to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your users as an added layer of security.

This feature is useful if you would like to see what that user sees when they log in to KnowBe4. This feature can be useful when configuring <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015389767-Security-Roles-Guide'>Security Role</a> permissions for a user or in other scenarios where you may need visibility into your users\u2019 experience.</p>\n<p>You can also perform actions as a user while impersonating them. Any action taken while impersonating a user will be applied to their account. For example, if you impersonate a user and start their training, the training will show as <strong>In Progress</strong> for that user the next time they log in. If you complete their training, it will show as <strong>Completed</strong> for them the next time they log in to KnowBe4.</p>\n<p>This feature can only be used to impersonate users who have previously logged in to KnowBe4. Users who have admin privileges in your KSAT console cannot be impersonated. Additionally, any time a user is impersonated will show as an event in the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/23542330166163-KnowBe4-Audit-Log-Overview'>audit log</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After navigating to a user\u2019s <strong>User Dashboard</strong> subtab, you\u2019ll see the <strong>Impersonate User</strong> button in the top-right corner.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/user_profile/ImpersonateUserButton.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/user_profile/ImpersonateUserButton.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Once the button is selected, you'll receive a confirmation prompt.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/user_profile/ImpersonateAreYouSure.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/user_profile/ImpersonateAreYouSure.png' alt=''> </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Selecting <strong>Confirm</strong> will allow you to impersonate the user.

This element displays a grey silhouette icon followed by the user name, \"Fritz Connell,\" concluding with a downward-pointing caret (indicating a dropdown menu for profile options).\n3.  **Call-to-Action (CTA):** In the lower-left section, a rectangular, orange button is displayed with white text that reads: \"Learn More.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n\nAn external, thick orange arrow is superimposed on the screenshot. It originates from the bottom right and points directly towards the boundary between the orange header and the user navigation strip, aiming generally towards the \"Fritz Connell\" user profile element.",

The user will receive an explanation so that even if they answer incorrectly, they can learn about the right answer. Because knowledge checks explain key concepts to users, they are considered additional training within training modules.</p>\n<p>A quiz can be found at the end of some training modules to test how much knowledge the user has retained. The default passing score on most quizzes is 80%. However, you can adjust the quiz passing score on some pieces of content using the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/8419812847763'>Content Manager</a>. If the user doesn\u2019t pass the quiz, they can review the questions and retake the quiz to achieve the passing score. Because quizzes ensure that user has retained key concepts, they are considered additional training within training modules.</p>\n<p>Some content will offer a test-out option that you can configure in the Content Manager. If available, you can turn on the test-out toggle to allow users to take the course quiz before they start the training. If users achieve a passing score on the quiz, they can skip this training course.

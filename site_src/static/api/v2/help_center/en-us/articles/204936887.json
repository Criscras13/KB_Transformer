Groups can be used to target certain departments or create spear-phishing attempts on key staff members. You can even target multiple groups in a single phishing campaign. By using groups, you can conduct phishing campaigns for specific regions or locations if you are interested in obtaining specific metrics from these campaigns.</p>\n<p>We recommend that you create groups for different locations, repeat clickers, management, and other sets of high-risk users. Our Smart Groups feature helps with the creation of these types of groups. You can learn more about Smart Groups (Platinum or Diamond only) in our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/8354913796115'>Smart Groups Overview</a> article.</p>\n<p>To see how Groups are doing in terms of their Phish-prone Percentage and number of phishing failures, such as clicks, go to <strong>Phishing</strong> &gt; <strong>Reports</strong> to use our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007952894-Advanced-Reporting-Guide'>Reporting</a> feature.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HC01D0M8W7JZYKRTRNMBMEBW'>Groups and Training Campaigns</h2>\n<p>When you set up a training campaign, you can choose to enroll all users or only enroll specific groups of users.</p>\n<p>You can also set up an automated remedial training for a Clickers group to provide additional training to users who frequently fail tests from phishing campaigns. Then, you can remove those users from the Clickers group upon completion of the remedial training. You can also re-enroll the users in the future if they fail another phishing test. For more information about remedial training, read our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/206280728-Using-Groups-for-Remedial-Training'>Using Groups for Remedial Training</a> article.</p>\n<p>You can use groups to track training progress and run reports on different groups of users. For example, you could find out how many members of the Clickers group have started but not completed a specific course. Any training-related report can also be filtered by group. Group reports can be found on the <strong>Reports</strong> tab as well as under the main Reports tab, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007952894-Advanced-Reporting-Guide'>Reporting</a> article for more information.</p>\n<p>You can also use groups to track the training progress of users on a staggered or ordered basis. For example, you could set up four campaigns, one for each quarter of the year. Each campaign can start at the beginning of each quarter, with the Q1 campaign targeting All Users. The subsequent three campaigns can target a Q2 group, Q3 group, and Q4 group. Your Q1 campaign could add completed users to the Q2 group, your Q2 campaign could add completed users to the Q3 group, and so on. This way, users will only be enrolled in the additional courses if they have completed the previous campaign's courses, such as a prerequisite.</p>",

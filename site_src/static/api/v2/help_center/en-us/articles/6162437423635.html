  "body": "<p>Integrating KnowBe4 with your Active Directory (AD) allows you to add your users and groups from your AD to your KSAT console and simplifies managing your users and groups.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01G2TCJWRE73EHW2BKBE8YHKTE'>User Management Benefits</h2>\n<p>ADI allows you to manage your user list in KnowBe4 through your AD. When changes are made in your AD, these changes will be automatically updated in your KSAT console during the next sync. For example, any time you add, archive, or change a user in your AD, the same action will happen to your user in your KSAT console.</p>\n<p>Additionally, instead of manually <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204936887#MANAGING%20GROUPS'>creating and managing user groups</a> in KnowBe4, if you use ADI, you can sync user groups from your AD, and these user groups will be automatically created in your KSAT console.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01G2TCKHRVN00KB2869W2NWBSH'>Phishing Campaign Benefits</h2>\n<p>When setting up ADI, you will specify the user information in the provisioning fields, such as a phishing language, that you want to sync from your AD into the user profiles in your KSAT console. When you add this user information to your console, you can create better phishing templates by using our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204949707#USER'>user information placeholders</a>. These placeholders pull the data from your users' profiles and allow you to create more targeted phishing templates that you can use in your campaigns.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when users are added to KnowBe4 through ADI, they will be automatically added to phishing campaigns assigned to <strong>All Users</strong> and to the groups to which these new users were added. To learn more, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204239938'>Creating and Managing Phishing Campaigns</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01G2TCMGG02ECXQ0QTX2DBFN6F'>Training Campaign Benefits</h2>\n<p>When users are added to your KSAT console through ADI, they will be automatically added to the appropriate training campaigns where the <strong>Enable automatic enrollment for new users</strong> setting is enabled. Use the user training language set for your user provisioning field here.</p>\n<p>To learn more, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204948207'>Training Campaigns Guide</a>.</p>",

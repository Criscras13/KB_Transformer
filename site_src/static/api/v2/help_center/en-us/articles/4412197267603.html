  "body": "<p>In the <strong>Policy Management</strong> module of your KCM GRC platform, you can create policy campaigns to send policies to your users. When your users receive the policies in their email, they can read and acknowledge them. Then, as your users acknowledge the policies, you can monitor your campaign progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>See the sections below to learn how to create and manage policy campaigns. For general information about the <strong>Policy Management</strong> module, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000727248' target='_self'>Policy Management Module Guide</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id='h_01J82JPNXQP7PRSFMQ3W0VV24M'>Creating Campaigns</h2>\n<p>When you create a campaign, you can select the policy or policies that you would like to assign to your users. You can also set campaign notifications to prompt your users to acknowledge the policies.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-remember'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong>Before you create a campaign, you will need to add policy management users to policy management groups. To learn how to create policy management users and groups, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412346622099' target='_self'>How to Add Users and Groups to the Policy Management Module</a>.\u00a0</div>\n</div>\n<p>To create a policy campaign, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>From the navigation panel, navigate to <strong>Policy Management</strong>\u00a0&gt; <strong>Campaigns</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the top-right corner of the page, click the <strong>Create Campaign</strong> button.</li>\n<li>Fill out the fields on the <strong>Create a New Campaign</strong> page. For more information about these fields, see the list below:\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>We recommend that you avoid including the &lt; and &gt; special characters in these fields.</div>\n</div>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCM+Policy+Management/KCM_Create+a+Campaign+Page.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCM+Policy+Management/KCM_Create+a+Campaign+Page.png' alt='Create Campaign Page PNG'></a></p>\n<ol role='list' type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Name: </strong>Enter a name for your campaign.

To learn about each type of end date, see the list below:\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Specify Date: </strong>Select this option to set a specific end date for the campaign. When you select this option, <strong>End Date</strong> and\u00a0<strong>End Time\u00a0</strong>fields will appear. In these fields, you can select the date and time that you would like for your campaign to end on.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relative Duration</strong>: Select this option to set a deadline based on when users are enrolled in the campaign. When you select this option, a <strong>Relative Duration</strong> field will appear. In this field, you can select the amount of time that users will have to acknowledge the policy or policies after you add the users to the campaign. The campaign notifications that you set up will be sent to users based on when they are enrolled in the campaign.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No End Date</strong>: Select this option to create the campaign without an end date. If you would like to encourage your users to promptly acknowledge your organization's policies, we do not recommend that you select this option.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Link Expiration</strong>: Select the amount of time that users can click the policy link before the link expires. We recommend that you select a time length that corresponds with the type of end date you selected for this campaign. For more information about the recommended link expirations, see the list below:\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>\n<strong>Specify Date</strong>: We recommend that you select a link expiration that comes before the campaign's end date because policy acknowledgments will not be recorded after the campaign ends.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relative Duration</strong>: We recommend that you select a link expiration that is the same length of time as the relative duration. When users receive campaign notifications for campaigns with <strong>Relative Duration </strong>selected, the notifications will instruct the users to acknowledge the policy before the link expiration date.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No End Date</strong>: Because this campaign does not have an end date, you can select any link expiration. When your users receive campaign notifications for the campaign, the notifications will instruct the users to acknowledge the policy before the link expiration date.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Select Campaign Policy(ies)</strong>: From the drop-down menu, select the policy or policies that you would like for your users to acknowledge.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Select Campaign Group(s)</strong>: From the drop-down menu, select the user groups that you would like to include in the campaign. For example, if your organization uses policies that only apply to specific job roles, you may want to create role-based user groups and policy campaigns. To learn more about user groups, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412346622099#GROUPS' target='_self'>Creating Policy Management Groups</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412346622099' target='_self'>How to Add Users and Groups to the Policy Management Module</a> article.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatically enroll users that are added in the future: </strong>Select this check box if you would like to automatically enroll users as they are added to the groups that are included in the campaign.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Notifications: </strong>Click the <strong>+</strong> button to expand this menu.

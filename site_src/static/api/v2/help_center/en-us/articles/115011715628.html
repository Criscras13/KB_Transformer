  "body": "<p>Because our phishing templates mimic real-life phishing attacks, your mail server may block them. Without whitelisting our servers, our templates may end up in your users' Junk or Spam folders or blocked entirely.</p>\n<p>If our templates are unable to reach your users, it will be impossible to get an accurate representation of your organization's Phish-prone Percentage.</p>\n<p>Your users will also be inadequately prepared to defend your organization when a real, dangerous phishing email gets past your mail filters.</p>\n<p>Properly whitelisting KnowBe4's mail servers will guarantee the delivery of phishing test emails and training notifications.

You can prequalify risk, assess your vendors, and conduct remediation efforts all in one platform. The VRM module is available to Platinum subscriptions.</p>\n<p>As part of working in the VRM module, you can create a \"vendor profile\" for each of the internal or external third parties that you will be working with. Then, you can use vendor profiles to send questionnaire assessments and to work through any issues that may arise from assessment responses. From vendor profiles, you can also modify vendor scores and create risks for vendors.\u00a0</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> As a best practice for onboarding with the VRM module, we suggest\u00a0<a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021582594' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>creating questionnaire assessments</a> before creating vendor profiles.

The <strong>Vendors</strong> page serves as a repository of the vendor profiles you have added to your account. To navigate to this page, from the navigation panel, click <strong>Vendor Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Vendors</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Much of your VRM workflow will be carried out through vendor profiles, for example:</p>\n<ul role='list'>\n<li>Adding user accounts for vendor contacts</li>\n<li>Sending questionnaires</li>\n<li>Reviewing questionnaires</li>\n<li>Creating issues for questionnaire responses</li>\n<li>Communicating with vendors about questionnaire issues</li>\n<li>Closing questionnaire issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you've added vendor profiles to your account, your <strong>Vendors</strong>\u00a0page will look similar to the image below.<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCMVendor/Vendor_VendorList/VendorList.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/KCM/KCMVendor/Vendor_VendorList/VendorList.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>The <strong>Name</strong> column displays the third-party organization's name.

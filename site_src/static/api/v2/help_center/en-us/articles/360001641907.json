Any edits made to the policy will be automatically reflected in the policy campaign. This includes any additional language versions of the policy that you may add.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can you preview all language versions of the policy?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>You can only preview the default version of the policy in the console. If you'd like to preview the remaining language versions, temporarily change the default version of the policy to the language version you\u2019d like to preview.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question: </strong>Can I arrange the order of the content I assign through training campaigns?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. From the <strong>Create New Training Campaign</strong> page, drag and drop the content in the desired order. When your users log in to complete their training or acknowledge policies, they'll see the content in the order you set. For an example of how to rearrange content, see the gif below.<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy+Management/ChangeContentOrder.gif'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy+Management/ChangeContentOrder.gif' alt=' '></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why can't I see or select my policy when I create a training campaign?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Before you can add the policy to a training campaign, the policy must be in the <strong>Published</strong> status. To change the status of a policy, click the drop-down arrow to the far right of the policy name. Select <strong>Edit</strong>. Then, select <strong>Published</strong> from the <strong>Status</strong> drop-down menu and click <strong>Update Policy</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why don't the \"Users who did not acknowledge their course policies\" and \"Users who acknowledged their course policies\" reports under the <strong>Reports</strong> subtab include my policy campaign users?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> These specific reports are related to the alternative method of mandating policy acknowledgments through your console. If you would like reports for your training campaigns that include PDF policies, see the <a href='#h_01FNRNKKG93KK9P2ECDK9ZJM1D' target='_self'>Monitoring Policy Acknowledgments</a> section of this article.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can I assign Security Roles to a user that I want to handle policy management, distribution, and acknowledgment?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. You can add one or more users to a group in your console for the purpose of assigning the necessary Security Roles for policy management. For more information, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015389767-How-to-Use-Security-Roles' target='_self'>How to Use Security Roles</a> article.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a maximum file size for policy PDF files?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. However, the system may time out if the PDF file is large. If the system times out, try to reduce the file size and upload the file again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Question: </strong>I included links in my policy and I can't click them. Why can\u2019t I click the links?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If you are using a MacBook and you want to include clickable links in your policy, you must use a PDF file that has been created in Adobe Acrobat.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

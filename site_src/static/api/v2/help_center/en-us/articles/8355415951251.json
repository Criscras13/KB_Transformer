    "body": "<p>In this article, you\u2019ll learn how to automate remedial training, periodic training, and a variety of other training processes with Smart Groups. Remedial training automatically assigns training content to users who fail a Phishing Security Test (PST). Periodic training allows you to assign sets of training content at specific times or in a specific order. The additional training processes in this article can help you train specific groups of users, such as new hires, based on your organization\u2019s needs.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> We offer an editable worksheet to help you plan your training campaign settings. To download this worksheet, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/7879267662739'>Phishing and Training Campaign Planning Resources</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<p>For general information about using Smart Groups, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/8293053887251'>Smart Groups Quickstart Guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HA58G63PW9KTS750339NWB5V'>Automated Remedial Training</h2>\n<p>We recommend automating remedial training enrollments for users who fail a <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/204843728'>Phishing Security Test (PST)</a>. When a user fails a PST, they will be automatically added to a Smart Group and assigned remedial training content of your choice. If they complete the training and fail another PST, they will receive a second round of remedial training content. This process encourages your phish-prone users to develop strong security habits.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HA58GAQAKKZ6Y774H3PPE0CP'>Step One: Choose Your Remedial Training Content</h3>\n<p>Before you build your automated training process, plan how many rounds of remedial training you would like to create. The number of PSTs a user fails will determine how many rounds of training they\u2019re assigned. For example, a user who fails two PSTs will be enrolled in two rounds of training. A standard remedial training plan includes three rounds of training, with one training campaign per round.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to download a planning worksheet for your training campaigns, see our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/7879267662739'>Phishing and Training Campaign Planning Resources</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve finished your planning, browse the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001221467'>ModStore</a> to choose the training content you want to assign in each round of remedial training. We recommend selecting training content about common phishing threats and social engineering red flags. If you need help choosing training content, the <strong>Phish-Prone Recommendations</strong> section of the ModStore has training options for phish-prone users. Also, be sure to choose content that you haven\u2019t assigned to any other training campaign. Adding unique content ensures that your remedial training Smart Groups will work properly.</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve selected your training content, you can begin creating your Smart Groups.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HA58GFSBZV07TBM4Q2MM5J26'>Step Two: Create a Smart Group for Each Round of Remedial Training</h3>\n<p>Next, create a Smart Group to correspond with each round of remedial training.

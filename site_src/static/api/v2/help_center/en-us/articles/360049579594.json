In your KCM GRC platform, you can create a control individually by creating a custom control or by creating a control from a requirement. You can also create controls in bulk by using a CSV file or by creating controls from requirements. We recommend that you create controls individually so you can focus on one compliance objective at a time.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> We include guidance for the requirements under many of the <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360022753993.html' target='_self'>managed templates</a> that KCM GRC offers. Guidance provides information that can help you create controls to satisfy requirements. To learn more about the guidance under our managed templates, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360049325813.html' target='_self'>How to Work with Control Guidance</a> article.</div>\n</div>\n<p>See the sections below to learn how to create controls individually and create controls in bulk.</p>\n<div class='callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong> After you've created and mapped your controls to requirements, we recommend that you create recurring tasks for your controls. Recurring tasks can help your organization demonstrate that it is consistently meeting its compliance requirements.

Once you've created one or more scopes, you can navigate to the <strong>View Scoped Requirement</strong> page to create individual controls for scoped requirements. You can either create custom controls or create controls from the scoped requirements. When you create a control from the <strong>View Scoped Requirements</strong> page, the control will automatically be mapped to the scoped requirement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To navigate to a <strong>View Scoped Requirement</strong> page, follow the steps below.</p>\n<ol role='list'>\n<li>From the navigation panel, select the\u00a0<strong>Scopes</strong> tab (<strong>Compliance</strong> &gt; <strong>Scopes</strong>).</li>\n<li>From the <strong>View All Scopes</strong> page, select a scope under the <strong>Name</strong> column.

The RBAC model allows you to assign user roles to your users so that they can only access the information that they need to perform their responsibilities. This model prevents users from having access to privileged or unnecessary information. You can assign multiple user roles to users who need to perform multiple responsibilities or work in different modules of your platform.</p>\n<p>To learn how to create users accounts and assign user roles, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019709833#CREATING' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Creating User Accounts</a> section of our <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019709833' target='_self'>How to Create and Manage KCM GRC User Accounts</a> article.

    "body": "<p>In May of 2022, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s National Assembly passed Bill 96 to promote the use of the French language in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec. Taking effect in June 2023, the law requires, among other things, that all policies and training materials assigned to employees within the province be provided in the French language.\u00a0</p>\n<p>KnowBe4 recognizes the value of providing content in the language in which employees are most comfortable learning, not just in Canada, but throughout the world. To that end, we have supported Canadian French (Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois) as a major language for five years (See our\u00a0<a href='https://www.knowbe4.com/security-awareness-training-languages' target='_self'>Language Support List</a>) and we continue to provide materials in French where it is culturally appropriate. We also localized much of this content (by providing local voices and examples in Canadian French) where it makes sense to do so. At the time of this writing, there are 486 pieces of content in our ModStore available in French, and also 475 pieces of content that are localized in Canadian French.\u00a0</p>\n<p>End users may select their preferred language in our Learner Experience (LX), so we highly recommend offering these options when assigning any content to users in the region. While there are many pieces of training content that are dubbed with a French voice, some are only captioned based on the context of the training content. We are committed to working with local organizations to identify French content that would benefit from being fully localized.\u00a0 As an example of our commitment, we are continuing to dub seasons 3 through 5 of The Inside Man in French (in addition to seasons 1 and 2, which are already fully dubbed) and hope to have them available in time for cybersecurity awareness month (October 2023).\u00a0 We always welcome feedback, so if you believe a piece of training content requires translation or localization to meet the requirements of the bill, please feel free to reach out to us.\u00a0</p>\n<p>KnowBe4 is committed to providing the highest quality security awareness and compliance content in the world. Our global team is focused on providing local content options for all of our customers. Keeping Canadians safe from cybercrime, as well as compliant with laws and regulations, is an important mission of KnowBe4. We will continue adding more content to our library to meet the needs of our growing base of valued customers and partners.</p>\n",

Sometimes, these tactics will appear in our Reported Phishes of the Week phishing template topic. This topic contains the top 10 phishing emails users have reported to us using the Phish Alert Button (PAB) in the previous week. Our security research team picks these emails each week, then we use them to create new phishing templates.</p>\n<p>The recommended settings for a phishing campaign with the Reported Phishes of the Week template topic are listed below. With these settings, you can phish all of your users at different times with randomized templates. If you'd prefer not to set up an additional campaign, you can choose to include this topic as part of other phishing campaigns.<a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/reportedphishesoftheweek_settings.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/phishing+campaigns/reportedphishesoftheweek_settings.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>\n<strong>Campaign Name:</strong> Enter a descriptive name, such as \"Reported Phishes of the Week\".</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Send to:</strong> Select <strong>All Users</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Frequency:</strong> Select <strong>Weekly</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Start Time:</strong> We recommend starting your campaign on a Wednesday since templates are typically updated Monday evenings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sending Period:</strong> Send emails over 3-5 business days.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Track Activity:</strong> Leave the setting as-is.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Track Replies to Phishing Emails: </strong>Select this check box to see if your users will reply to the simulated phishing email they receive.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Template Topics:</strong> Select <strong>Reported Phishes of the Week</strong> and <strong>Full Random</strong>.\n<div class='callout callout-note'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Note:</strong>This topic will be updated weekly so your users will receive the newest phishing templates each time the campaign runs.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Difficulty Rating:</strong> Leave this setting as-is.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Phish Link Domain:</strong> Leave this setting as-is.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Landing Page: </strong>Keep\u00a0<strong>Default Landing Pages</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class='callout-warning'>\n<div class='callout__content'>\n<strong>Important:</strong> If your organization's culture requires that you get approval on the kinds of templates you use to test your users, you should not set up an automated phishing campaign using this category.

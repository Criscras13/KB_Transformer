    "body": "<p>Your organization may have recently installed the Gmail Add-on Phish Alert Button (PAB). In this article, you will learn how this tool works and how you can use it to help keep your organization safe from malicious phishing emails.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01HPF7PT5W1A63TP5HEYRGZQ3T'>When to Use the PAB</h2>\n<p>You should select the PAB anytime you suspect that you have received a phishing email or any potentially dangerous email.

You should report each potential phishing email individually. However, if you report an email that has multiple emails associated with it, all of the associated emails will be reported as well.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01HPF7PT5WZPXAW7X7AQ3W6XT3'>Gmail Inbox</h3>\n<p>To use the PAB add-on in your Gmail inbox, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your Gmail account on your web browser.</li>\n<li>Open the email that you would like to report.</li>\n<li>Open the add-on menu on the right side of your Google inbox and select the <strong>phish hook</strong> icon to open the PAB add-on.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB-FAQ/GPAB/GmailAddOnPAB.gif'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB-FAQ/GPAB/GmailAddOnPAB.gif' alt=' ' width='567' height='290'></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>(Optional) You can also add comments and select a disposition to provide more information about the email.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB-FAQ/GPAB/GmailPABComments.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB-FAQ/GPAB/GmailPABComments.png' alt=' ' width='526' height='328'></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Select the blue <strong>Phish Alert</strong> button to report the email.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB-FAQ/GPAB/GmailPABReporting.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PAB-FAQ/GPAB/GmailPABReporting.png' alt=' ' width='526' height='328'></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>Once the confirmation message appears, select the back arrow to go back to your inbox.

Because the potential phishing emails you report are sent to your organization for analysis, your organization will be aware of which phishing attacks are able to reach their users' inboxes. Once everyone is aware of possible vulnerabilities, they can better defend against cyber attacks. You are an important part of the process of keeping your organization safe from cybercriminals. Stop, look, and think!</p>",

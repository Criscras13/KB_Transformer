These modules are no longer than five minutes long and are designed to engage your users on their mobile devices. Our mobile-first modules are brandable and SCORM-compliant, so you can download these modules to use in your own LMS.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/modstore/Mobile+First+Modules.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.amazonaws.com/modstore/Mobile+First+Modules.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audiocasts</strong>: Audiocasts are bite-sized audio lessons that deliver focused insights in a convenient, easily digestible format, perfect for on-the-go learning.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/modstore/audiocasts_modstore2.png'><img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/modstore/audiocasts_modstore2.png' alt=' '></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To reinforce important concepts in the training content, many of our modules and games include knowledge checks or quizzes.</p>\n<p>Knowledge checks can be found anywhere within a training module and help solidify key training concepts by presenting the user with a question. The user will receive an explanation so that even if they answer incorrectly, they can learn about the right answer. Because knowledge checks explain key concepts to users, they are considered additional training within training modules.</p>\n<p>A quiz can be found at the end of some training modules to test how much knowledge the user has retained. The default passing score on most quizzes is 80%. However, you can adjust the quiz passing score on some pieces of content using the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/8419812847763'>Content Manager</a>. If the user doesn\u2019t pass the quiz, they can review the questions and retake the quiz to achieve the passing score. Because quizzes ensure that user has retained key concepts, they are considered additional training within training modules.</p>\n<p>Some content will offer a test-out option that you can configure in the Content Manager. If available, you can turn on the test-out toggle to allow users to take the course quiz before they start the training. If users achieve a passing score on the quiz, they can skip this training course.

The questions, connected by red lines, include: \"Is the author credible?\", \"Are all the facts accurate?\", \"Is the source of the information legitimate?\", \"Is the headline trying to cause a strong emotional reaction?\", \"Is the date current?\", and \"Has the image been altered?\". The concluding instruction is: \"Check sources and articles by using fact-checking websites before posting or forwarding any information.\"\n\n**Poster 2 (Center: Phish Alert Button - PAB)**\nThis poster features a yellow background with radial rays and a photograph of a female employee dressed as a superhero (red mask and cape). The primary text reads: \"YOU Just saved the day!\" Below this, a graphic depicts a jagged speech bubble or explosion containing a stylized 'J' icon (referencing the 'Junk' or 'Report' action). The explicit callout at the bottom is: \"You used the PAB! (The Phish Alert Button).\"\n\n**Poster 3 (Right: Password Strength)**\nThe poster is titled \"PUMP UP YOUR PASSWORD STRENGTH,\" featuring a cartoon padlock icon above the title.

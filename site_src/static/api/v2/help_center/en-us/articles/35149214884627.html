PhishML Insights is an AI model that explains how the PhishML machine-learning feature determines the dispositions of messages.</p>\n<h2 id='h_01JEPYA1KD41NNJT162373AZQ5'>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before you can use PhishML Insights, you will need to have a PhishER Plus subscription and enable PhishML in your PhishER console. Then, PhishML Insights will be automatically enabled and available.

Each explanation displays up to three of the strongest reasons PhishML used to determine the disposition of the message. If PhishML was unable to determine a confidence value above 50 percent for any of the dispositions, the explanation would indicate that PhishML was unsure of the disposition. You can click <strong>Close Explanation</strong> to hide the explanation from view on the <strong>Actions</strong> subtab and click <strong>View Explanation</strong> to display it again.</p>",

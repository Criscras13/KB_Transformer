    "body": "<p>In this guide, you\u2019ll learn how to get started with Defend. Defend is a powerful cybersecurity tool that safeguards your organization against sophisticated inbound threats. Defend analyzes your mail flow before delivery and provides protection that keeps your users and sensitive data secure. You can use the Defend console to customize security settings and conduct thorough investigations of detected and user-reported phishing emails.</p>\n<p>To access the Defend console, you must first use the deployment center to deploy Defend for your organization.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Deployment+Center/DC+Login.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Deployment+Center/DC+Login.png' alt='Defend deployment center login screen'> </a></p>\n<h2 id='h_01JV4VZ96PV5TT49ZMFXF05QAP'>Deployment Center</h2>\n<p>The Defend deployment center is a comprehensive wizard that allows admins to configure and deploy Defend features to their organization easily. Admins are guided through each section of the deployment process, and progress is saved at every step. Once the deployment center is complete, admins gain access to the Defend console, where further customization can be completed.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JV4W09PV0NJXB8NVDVKXTQT6'>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To successfully complete the deployment center process, make sure you have the following prerequisites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft 365 tenant</li>\n<li>Global admin role on Microsoft 365 tenant</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id='h_01JV4W1PBJBJ93TNH32CRCCDHV'>Deployment Center Steps</h3>\n<p>The following steps are completed in the deployment center:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Validation</strong>: Ensure your current email system is ready for deployment. Defend will analyze your email system to ensure compatibility with the deployment process and the Defend service.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Deployment+Center/DC+Validation+Complete.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Deployment+Center/DC+Validation+Complete.png' alt=''></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tenancy and Secure Email Gateway (SEG)</strong>: Confirm your primary domain, industry, and SEG provider. For more information about the fields on the <strong>Tenancy and Secure Email Gateway (SEG)</strong> page, see the list below.\n<p><a data-fancybox='single' data-src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Deployment+Center/DC+Domain.png'> <img src='https://helpimg.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Defend/Deployment+Center/DC+Domain.png' alt='The tenancy and secure email gateway screen of the Defend Deployment Center with Primary Domain, Industry, and Secure Email Gateway'></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Primary Domain</strong>: Defend will detect and provide a list of internal domains. Review the list and select your organization's primary domain.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Industry</strong>: Use the drop-down menu to select the most appropriate industry for your organization. Industry information enables Defend to address industry-specific threats.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Secure Email Gateway (SEG)</strong>: Select if your organization uses a SEG.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Impersonation</strong>: Customize your impersonation protection by providing your organization's associated domains and brand names.

Each Defend tenant has a unique domain assigned to it that is randomly generated.\n<p>For example, \u201caaaaa.c.us1.defend.com\u201d, where \u201caaaaa\u201d is a randomly generated string that is unique to each Defend customer.</p>\n<p>This feature allows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Microsoft 365 inbound connector validates emails coming from Defend and attributes those emails to your Microsoft 365 tenant. The certificate used to send emails from Defend to your Microsoft 365 must match an accepted domain on your tenant to ensure uninterrupted mail flow.</li>\n<li>Defend to DKIM-sign all emails before returning them to your Microsoft 365 tenant. For security reasons, this signature is unique to each tenant and uses your unique domain.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div title='Connectors'>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Connector</th>\n<th scope='col'>Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Microsoft 365 to Defend</td>\n<td>Route mail to Defend for processing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Defend to Microsoft 365</td>\n<td>Route mail back to Microsoft 365 for delivery to the user</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div title='User Groups'>\n<h3 id='h_01JZJRBR2FDE8YQ1QKSVNCDBNQ'>Defend User Group</h3>\n<p>The default name for the Defend user group is \"Defend_User_Group\". Users in this group will have their emails processed by Defend.</p>\n<p>You can use dynamic expressions to add all users to the \"Defend_User_Group\" automatically. Two examples of dynamic expressions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(user.mail -ne null)</li>\n<li>(user.userType -eq \"Member\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For new deployments via the Deployment Center, the Defend User Group now includes the legacy graymail and spam groups mentioned below.</p>\n<h3 id='h_01JZJRFDCTC0A75A6JVRDF5FGQ'>Legacy Groups</h3>\n<p>The following groups may exist in your Microsoft tenant if you have used a previous Defend deployment tool:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Graymail User Group</strong>: The graymail group contains users who have access to Defend\u2019s graymail functionality. Custom group names can be specified in the <strong>Graymail User Group</strong> field on the Defend <strong>Settings</strong> page. For more information on managing and enabling the Graymail user groups, see the <a href='https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/en-us/articles/35666064197395'>Defend - Graymail Management</a> article.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Spam User Group</strong>: The spam group contains users who receive spam protection functionality in Defend. Custom group names can be specified in the <strong>Spam User Group</strong> field.

This feature enables IT admins to test Defend functionality and train users at their own pace.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Defend_Graph_Users Group</strong>: A Graph API only group used during POV deployments where the SMTP transport rules are not activated. All Defend functionality operates via the Microsoft Graph API for users in this group.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div title='Transport Rules'>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope='col'>Transport Rule</th>\n<th scope='col'>Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Defend Add Internal Header*</td>\n<td>This rule allows admins to opt in to keep banners and rewritten links when forwarding an internal email to another Defend user.

    "body": "<p>In this article, you will learn how to integrate Palo Alto Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) with SecurityCoach. Once the integration is complete, data provided by Palo Alto NGFW will be available in the <strong>SecurityCoach</strong> tab of your KnowBe4 Security Awareness Training (KSAT) console. This data can be viewed in SecurityCoach reports and can be used to create detection rules for real-time coaching campaigns. For more information about SecurityCoach, see our <a href='https://Criscras13.github.io/KB_Transformer/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/6654432814355.html'>SecurityCoach Product Manual</a>.</p>\n<div class='callout-tip'>\n<div>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>SecurityCoach also supports integrating Palo Alto NGFW as a Splunk vendor.
